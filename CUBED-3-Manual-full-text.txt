ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The CUBED-3 has been a long-term project with its genesis trailing back nearly 20 years. Prior to
working as researchers, we were educators in the public school system in several states across the
U.S. The CUBED-3 was developed in response to measurement weaknesses that we noted while
working with students with and without disabilities. These measurement weaknesses were not subtle.
For the most part, the valid assessment of comprehension in the early grades was entirely lacking
(as was any accompanying multi-tiered instruction for language). The static measures used to assess
reading grossly misidentified many students, especially those who were culturally, linguistically, and
economically diverse. Resolving these weaknesses became our mission.
Although just kernels of ideas at the time, our thoughts on how to address these measurement
problems have developed over the years, with considerable research, into what is now the CUBED-3
assessment. The research and development of the CUBED-3 could not have been possible without
the guidance, collaboration, and cooperation of many individuals. Upon the highest pedestal we place
our major professors, Dr. Ronald Gillam and Dr. Timothy Slocum, who guided us through our doctoral
programs with overwhelming support and individualized attention. We would also like to express
our deepest gratitude to Dr. Kate Kniss, Alisa Therkildsen, Dr. Megan Kirby, Courney Claar, Shaylee
Woods, Camryn Lettich, Devan Dawes, Sakthi Palanivelu, Subha Shanmuga, and Michael Petersen.
We also thank Dr. Melissa Allen, and Dr. Janet Tilstra for their contributions to the initial development
of draft stories. Special thanks go to Dr. Roger Steeve, Doris Snoozy, Eli Cox, Barb Farley, Dr. Liann
Brenneman, Sherri-lyn Harrison, Dr. Stella Nowell, Jerri Rauer, Cate Malone, Jessica Waldron, Lindsay
Curran, and the many students, teachers, and administrators, especially from the great states of
Wyoming, Utah, and Michigan who supported, endured, and shaped early versions of the CUBED-3.
Our research laboratory teams, comprised of well over two hundred undergraduate and graduate
students, deserve special recognition for the countless hours devoted to administering and scoring the
CUBED-3 for research and validation purposes. Their work, which continues to this day, has made this
assessment possible.
Note: As we are always interested in improving the CUBED-3, we encourage users to conduct
their own research. Please share your results, along with any suggestions for improving the
CUBED-3, to us in care of Language Dynamics Group, LLC, www.LanguageDynamicsGroup.com.

PREFACE
This manual is for the CUBED-3 assessment, yet the suite of assessments found in the online Insight
system (www.LDGInsight.com) and available in printed form includes the CUBED-3, the PEARL, and
the DYMOND. These assessments have different purposes and target different student populations.
The following section provides a brief overview of the PEARL and the DYMOND so that it is clear how
the CUBED-3 complements them. It is also important to understand that the CUBED-3 assessment
is designed to inform instruction and is a companion to any systematic, explicit, and sequential word
recognition program, and is specifically designed to be used with Story Champs, which is a multi-
tiered explicit, systematic, and sequential academic language program.
PEARL and DYMOND – The Dynamic Assessment Duo
The PEARL and the DYMOND include dynamic and processing dependent subtests that have the
purpose of quickly and accurately identifying children who struggle learning to decode and/or learning
to produce and understand complex academic language. The PEARL and DYMOND include dynamic
assessments of decoding, dynamic assessments of language, rapid automatized naming tasks, and
nonword repetition subtests. Preschool and kindergarten students are administered the PEARL, and
first through eighth grade students can be administered the DYMOND.
Students who do poorly on any of the language- or decoding-related subtests of the CUBED-3 and
who also do poorly on the corresponding dynamic assessment and processing dependent measures
of the PEARL or DYMOND very likely have a language disorder or dyslexia. This diagnosis should
lead to the immediate provision of intensive interventions specifically focused on a student’s profile of
needs.
Students who are below benchmark on the CUBED-3 assessment, yet who do not have a learning
disability according to the PEARL or DYMOND may still need more intensive interventions than their
peers who are at benchmark. However, the duration and intensity of those interventions will likely not
need to be as high as they will be for students with a learning disability.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CUBED-3
The CUBED-3 is primarily designed to be a universal screening and progress monitoring
assessment of word recognition and language for students in preschool through eighth grade.
The CUBED-3 will help identify students who are meeting benchmark expectations and will provide
information on progress over time. The results of the CUBED-3 can directly inform word recognition
and language instruction and can be used to examine the effectiveness of the school system’s
instructional supports. The CUBED-3 is best classified as a criterion-referenced general outcome
measure (GOM). However, the CUBED-3 can also be used as a norm-referenced assessment with the
aid of supplemental materials.
Reading comprehension is mostly dependent on the adequate development of two major constructs:
word recognition and oral language comprehension. We used this simple view of reading (Gough
and Tunmer, 1986), and Scarborough’s (2001) reading model as a general guide in the construction
of the CUBED-3. We also used Kamhi’s (2009) narrow view of reading, and Catts work on reading
comprehension (e.g., Catts et al., 2014) as a frame of reference, which served to remind us of the
importance of attending to the measurement of oral language and its constituent parts, and the need
to measure learning potential.

================================================================================
INTRODUCTION TO THE CUBED-3
The effort required to help a student develop proficient word recognition and oral language
comprehension is ultimately dependent upon a student’s learning potential. We use the word
learning in a very specific, precise way. Learning is the context-independent, long-term occurrence
of a particular behavior (Bjork, 2004; Kamhi, 2014). Students who have difficulty learning language,
which is an unconstrained communication process that is infinitely generative, have difficulty learning
broad-based rules and modifying those rules. Learning broad-based rules is crucial because, as
noted by Fey (1988) “language serves too many functions, expresses too many meanings, provides
too many lexical and syntactic options, and is formally too complex for us to ‘teach’ everything…”
(pg. 278). Similarly, children need to understand the code that is used to express the thousands of
words expressed in written form. This too is a broad-based skill that transfers across contexts and
that is necessary because, just like language, there are too many written words for us to ‘teach’ every
different word to a child. Once the code is broken, any word written in that code can be decoded.
Thus, a GOM for comprehension and word recognition must focus not just on what a student knows,
which can be confounded by multiple variables including what a student has been exposed to and
taught over time, but also on the ability of a student to learn broad-based skills and to apply those
broad-based skills across contexts. Accordingly, the CUBED-3 measures static word recognition
proficiency and the ability to learn the skill of recognizing words using the Dynamic Decoding
Measures (DDM). Through the Narrative Language Measures (NLM) Subtests, the CUBED-3 measures
static oral and written language comprehension and production, and the ability to learn oral and
written language comprehension and production. Learning potential is also measured using the
PEARL and DYMOND dynamic assessments.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CUBED-3
A Special Note on Measuring Comprehension
Many current general outcome measures used to identify early reading comprehension difficulties in
young students have two major flaws; (1) They do not focus on language comprehension at all for young
students, which is a major component of the simple view of reading, and (2) They do not sufficiently meet
all of the psychometric requirements for general outcome measurement as outlined by Deno (2003), with
particular weaknesses in construct validity. These widely used GOMs rely on three approaches to measure
reading comprehension: mazing, reading fluency, and number of words retold, which rely “more on code-
related skills than on language comprehension skills” (Muijselaar et al., 2017). These approaches do not
adequately describe language ability nor inform language instruction (Cao & Kim, 2021).
The CUBED-3 includes the Narrative Language Measures (NLM) subtests, which assess pre-k through
eighth grade students’ abilities to understand and use both oral and written academic language. The
NLM also directly informs comprehension instruction and meets all of the psychometric requirements
of a GOM, filling a major gap found in most reading general outcome measures.
The NLM subtests of the CUBED-3 have three major purposes: 1) benchmark screening, 2) progress
monitoring, and 3) intervention planning. The NLM Listening and NLM Reading were designed to
accurately identify students whose academic language places them at risk for experiencing other
academic problems. NLM Benchmark passages are to be used for universal screening three times per
year, which is common in multi-tiered systems of supports (MTSS). For universal screening purposes,
the academic language of all students within a district, school, or grade level should be assessed.
From the results of this benchmark screening process, two gross interpretations are possible,
not at risk or at risk, reflected by scores at and above the cut point or below it. This dichotomous
interpretation can be further divided along a continuum of performance ranging from significantly
below benchmark expectations for language-related difficulty to highly advanced skills, which may
help organize students into instructional groups according to their strengths and needs.
The NLM Listening and NLM Reading were also designed to monitor students’ language growth over time
due to instruction and/or supplemental intervention. Progress monitoring refers to the frequent sampling of
the behavior of interest and is typically reserved for students who are identified as at-risk during screening
and consequently receive intervention. Language progress monitoring helps educators detect whether
adequate progress is being made, and to identify what type of instructional modifications are necessary.
It is important to monitor progress so that mastery of an objective or achievement of a standard can
be detected. Progress monitoring can also be used with students who are in an accelerated program
to measure progress associated with specialized language instruction. Decisions about the skill areas
and targets to monitor are made at the individual student level. Language progress monitoring can be
conducted using grade-level or off-grade-level material, depending on the student’s needs.
The NLM subtests can serve as a basis for intervention planning. The results can provide information on
the integration of receptive and expressive language, reading fluency, reading comprehension, use of
complex linguistic structures, and the ability to infer the meaning of complex vocabulary in a standardized,
efficient, and valid manner. The content of the NLM Listening and NLM Reading is directly related
to common curriculum expectations. Decisions regarding the placement of students in intervention,
modification of intervention, and when to introduce new targets can be based directly on the results.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CUBED-3
Language Comprehension Strands and the CUBED-3 Narrative Language Measures (NLM)
The CUBED-3 uses the Narrative Language Measures (NLM) to assess a student’s ability to use and
understand oral and written academic language. The NLM is comprised of two subtests: the NLM
Listening and the NLM Reading. The NLM Listening and NLM Reading use parallel narratives with
embedded exposition to test the ability to retell complex academic narrative and expository language,
to answer factual and inferential questions, to measure writing and personal story generation, and to
measure reading fluency and reading comprehension. A brief dynamic assessment of language is used
to help identify students who have difficulty learning language.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CUBED-3
A Special Note on Measuring Word Recognition
General outcome measures for reading have primarily focused on tasks that measure skills such as
phonemic awareness, letter sounds, letter names, nonsense word recoding, and reading fluency.
Such GOMs, apart from the fact that they tend to lack valid measures of comprehension, have two
additional limitations; (1) They often do not provide sufficient information to inform word recognition
instruction, and (2) they rely exclusively on static information, which can be severely confounded by
prior exposure and experience, yielding floor effects with young students.
The CUBED-3 includes measures related to word recognition that will likely be familiar to many
educators. What is unique about the CUBED-3 is that it provides educators with the opportunity to
obtain a more comprehensive inventory of what a student can do if a student is not performing at
benchmark on any particular task. For example, the CUBED-3 includes measures of reading fluency
(including prosody), and benchmark expectations have been established for that task. Yet reading
fluency is an outcome measure that is affected by multiple underlying skills. The DDM subtests of the
CUBED-3 provide a way to assess those underling skills and to determine precisely where deficits
lie. Examiners will find multiple measures of phonemic awareness and nonsense word recoding that
are engineered to help identify a student’s current ability and to pinpoint precisely what needs to be
focused on in intervention.
Most static reading measures used to assess young students have poor classification accuracy and
significant floor effects (Badian, 1994; Catts, 1991; Jenkins & O’Connor, 2002; Mantzicopoulos &
Morrison, 1994; O’Connor & Jenkins, 1999; Scarborough, 1998; Torgesen, 2002a, 2002b; Uhry, 1993;
Wilson & Lonigan, 2010). When used to measure the reading abilities of culturally and linguistically
diverse (CLD) children just entering the school system at the beginning of kindergarten, static
measures demonstrate even lower classification accuracy and even greater floor effects (Donovan
& Cross, 2002; Gersten & Dimino, 2006; Klingner & Edwards, 2006; Petersen & Gillam, 2015). When
using the CUBED-3 in the Insight system, examiners can administer dynamic assessments of
decoding from the PEARL or DYMOND (depending on the student’s age) to glean information on
a student’s ability to learn how to decode in addition to their precise performance on the array of
measures in the CUBED-3. This focus on learning potential results in excellent classification accuracy,
mitigates floor effects, and reduces bias encountered using traditional static assessments.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CUBED-3
Word Recognition Strands and the CUBED-3
The CUBED-3 uses the Dynamic Decoding Measures (DDM) to assess word recognition-related
skills. The DDM is comprised of four subtests: Phonemic Awareness, Phoneme Manipulation,
Orthographic Mapping, and Decoding Inventory. The NLM Reading also includes a reading fluency
subtest. Each DDM subtest of the CUBED-3 assesses a specific target related to, or reflective of word
recognition following a testing the limits dynamic assessment approach. This means that students are
administered the more difficult or more mature targets first, and then subsequent targets are assessed
until a student’s current level of performance is identified. This testing the limits dynamic assessment
helps educators pinpoint where intervention should begin.

PURPOSES OF THE CUBED-3
The CUBED-3 is specifically designed to do the following:
a) Universal Benchmark Screening. The CUBED-3 is designed to accurately classify preschool
through eighth grade students along a continuum of performance ranging from significantly below
to significantly above expectations. This is accomplished through universal benchmark screening.
Benchmark screening refers to the assessment of all students within a district, school, or grade usually
three times per year. The purpose of benchmark screening is to identify strengths and weaknesses
of students, and to organize those students into instructional groups according to their strengths and
needs. For this purpose, the CUBED-3 is typically administered at the beginning, middle, and end of
each school year.
b) Progress Monitoring. The CUBED-3 is designed to monitor student progress regularly. Progress
monitoring refers to the frequent assessment of students who experience, or may be at risk for,
difficulty in the skills needed for reading comprehension. Progress monitoring helps educators detect
whether adequate progress is being made, and to identify what type of instructional modifications are
necessary. Progress monitoring can also be used with students who are in an accelerated program
to measure progress associated with specialized instruction. Decisions about the skill areas and
targets to monitor are made at the individual student level. Progress monitoring can be conducted
using grade-level or off-grade-level material, depending on the student’s needs. Thus, the CUBED-3
progress monitoring measures can be administered to students in preschool through high school
whenever appropriate.
Benchmark screening and progress monitoring are necessary assessment purposes in a multi-tiered
system of support. The CUBED-3 Administration Timeline (Figure 1 on page 18) shows the measures
that are typically administered at each benchmark assessment period. Different CUBED-3 measures
can be administered at different times to meet the needs at different schools. Therefore, the timeline
should only be considered a recommendation. The Administration Flowcharts (see page 19) can help
educators determine which specific subtests and targets to administer.
c) Identification of Students Performing Significantly Below Peers. Instead of interpreting the
results of the CUBED-3 according to pre-established criteria or expectations (criterion-referencing), the
results of the CUBED-3 for preschool through third grade students can also be interpreted according
to the normative sample (norm-referencing). An individual student’s performance can be compared to
his or her normative group. This information can be useful in classification/diagnostic processes.
d) Intervention Planning. The CUBED-3 includes static, dynamic assessment, and processing
measures which not only provide examiners with information on what a student already knows, they
also provide information on a student’s ability to learn and their underlying processing capacity.
Because of this, the results of the CUBED-3 can serve as a basis for intervention planning. The
format of the CUBED-3 ensures information is gathered in a standardized, efficient, valid manner so
that results inform instruction. This content is directly related to common curriculum expectations

and individual student’s performance on the CUBED-3 reveals the strengths and weaknesses that
can then be specifically addressed in intervention. Decisions regarding the placement of students in
intervention, modification of intervention, and when to introduce new targets can be based directly on
the CUBED-3 results.
e) Program Evaluation. The CUBED-3 results can be used to examine the extent to which special
instructional programs yield the desired outcomes and can help identify how the program can be
improved.
The CUBED-3:
• is valid, reliable, and efficient to administer and score
• identifies students who need intensive decoding, language, reading fluency, spelling, or writing
intervention
• informs the development of tailored interventions
• evaluates the effectiveness of interventions and monitors students’ progress in relation to
intervention
• plays an integral role in a multi-tiered system of support focusing on both decoding and language.

PURPOSES OF THE CUBED-3
Accommodations
Sometimes standardized administration of the CUBED-3 assessment could result in inaccurate results.
In these cases, approved assessment accommodations can be used. Approved accommodations are
those that will likely not alter how the assessment functions, thus the benchmark and cut points for
risk can still be referenced. These approved accommodations should be reserved for a select number
of students who truly need them.

Unapproved Accommodations
Unapproved accommodations could include repeating the story or question, or providing additional
prompts. When the purpose of using the CUBED-3 is to determine a student’s performance in
comparison to benchmarks or other students’ performances, unapproved accommodations should
not be used. However, when a student’s performance is compared to their own performance over
time, as in progress monitoring, unapproved accommodations can be used. It is recommended
though, that the accommodation is used consistently each time the assessment is administered
so that changes in scores can be validly attributed to changes in behavior and not changes in
assessment conditions. Unapproved accommodations can be used where they are necessary. For
example, a student may have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that specifies testing with an
unapproved accommodation, such as extra time to complete test items or the test directions given in
a student’s primary language that is other than English.

PURPOSES OF THE CUBED-3
Training
The CUBED-3 can be administered by paraprofessional and professional educators and other school-
approved personnel as long as they have been appropriately trained on the administration and scoring
procedures. The interpretation of the CUBED-3 requires additional training and expertise. It is the
organization’s and individual’s responsibility to ensure that sufficient training has been provided prior
to the administration, scoring, and interpretation of the CUBED-3 assessment. Language Dynamics
Group (www.languagedynamicsgroup.com) offers several training opportunities and provides video
tutorials as supplemental supports. To use scores for educational decisions, the examiner must reliably
administer the measures according to the procedures outlined in this manual. A fidelity checklist for
each measure is available.
Before administering the CUBED-3, examiners should carefully read this manual and practice
administering and scoring the measures until the administration and scoring are performed correctly
and fluently. The Insight system can facilitate fidelity of administration and reliability of scoring
because discontinue and benchmark parameters are automated.
Standardized administration is an essential part of the CUBED-3. There are scripts for examiners to
follow that help to ensure each measure is administered the same every time. If standardization is not
followed, it is impossible to determine whether changes in a student’s scores are a result of learning or
variations in test administrations. Examiners should follow the administration and scoring instructions
as directed on the protocols.

TIMING AND SELECTION OF CUBED-3
SUBTESTS AND TARGETS
Not all CUBED-3 subtests are appropriate or necessary to administer to all students. The CUBED-3
Administration Timeline (Figure 1) provides an overview of when the CUBED-3 subtests or targets are
typically administered. Keep in mind that these are only general guidelines, and that your organization
may have different needs. The Administration Flowcharts (see page 19) can be used to determine
when and how many of the CUBED-3 subtests and targets should be administered. Those areas that
are emphasized in the curriculum will drive the assessment process, and mastery or benchmark level
will determine whether certain subtests and targets are required.

ADMINISTRATION FLOWCHARTS
The Administration Flowcharts are designed to maximize efficiency while maintaining validity.
Examiners first administer the subtest in the column on the left side of the flowchart and work down
the column, following the arrows and boxes as directed by the key. After administering the appropriate
subtests or targets in the first column, examiners then administer the next subtests and targets in the
column to the right, again following the directions indicated by the key. The administration of many
of the subtests and targets is contingent on how a student performs. For example, note that for first
grade students at BOY, the NLM Reading benchmark is the first recommended subtest. The Decoding
Fluency, NLM Retell, and NLM Questions from that subtest are the suggested targets. If a student
is at benchmark on the Decoding Fluency and NLM Retell, no additional testing is recommended.
This is because the first grade BOY Decoding Fluency subtest includes a decodable section which
measures a first grader’s ability to decode words with closed syllables and basic affixes, and the NLM
Retell provides considerable information on how well a student can understand and produce complex
academic language. If a student is not at benchmark on either of those targets, then the examiner is
directed to administer additional subtests and targets to better identify specific needs. This logic is
applied to all grades, making the CUBED very efficient yet also very powerful. Educators may wish to
administer subtests that are not recommended in the flowchart, and the CUBED provides the flexibility
to accommodate specific organizational/student needs.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING
Selecting a Grade Level
The NLM benchmark screening measures are grade-specific, but the DDM benchmarking measures
are not grade-specific. Students should be administered the DDM assessments corresponding to the
benchmark recommendations (see Figures 1 and 2), or whenever there is a particular concern in a
given area. If a student reaches benchmark or mastery on any given target of the DDM at an early age,
that target area may not need to be re-administered in subsequent testing sessions.
The NLM benchmarks should be administered at the grade level corresponding to the student’s grade.
For students who can read, we recommend that the NLM Reading be administered first, and then if
comprehension is below expectations, the NLM Listening should be administered.
For NLM progress monitoring, it is generally recommended to use grade level materials, yet if the
grade level passages are too complex for progress monitoring a student’s language, then a lower
grade level should be considered. Keep in mind that the purpose of the benchmark assessments is
to compare students to a grade criterion, but the progress monitoring assessments are designed to
show an individual student’s decoding, language, and reading growth over time.
Materials and Setting
The examiner should sit with an individual student in a quiet place. If the examiner is right-handed, the
student should sit on the left side of the examiner. Most examiners prefer to have a printed copy of
the student stimulus materials even when administering the CUBED-3 using Insight (www.LDGInsight.
com), yet an additional electronic device (e.g., tablet or laptop) can be used to display the student
stimulus materials. If the examiner is using the Insight system, the printed record forms are not needed
because scoring takes place on a digital device. Insight requires a tablet, laptop, or some other
electronic device and an Internet connection. Examiners should ensure that Insight is fully functional
and compatible with their operating system, internet browser, and can be accessed past their
organization’s firewall prior to administering the CUBED-3. If Insight is not being used, examiners will
need a pen/pencil, the printed record forms upon which student scores are recorded, and the printed
student stimulus materials to which the student refers.
Student stimulus materials are required for some of the DDM Orthographic Mapping and Decoding
Inventory measures. For the NLM Reading, the examiner will need the student stimulus materials that
contains the stories the student will read. It is highly recommended to audio record the administration
of the NLM assessments so scores that were assigned in real-time can be reviewed and edited. The
student should wear a lapel microphone when they are being recorded. Examiners may wish to use
a speech to text program to transcribe the retell and then check the transcript to review and edit the
real-time scoring.

PAGE 26
================================================================================
ADMINISTRATION & SCORING
Rapport
It is important that the examiner builds rapport with each student before administering the
assessment. Young students may not be accustomed to the assessment procedures and are generally
more cautious with strangers. Keep in mind that the testing situation may be unusual and a little
uncomfortable for young students. The examiner should spend time getting to know the student or
have a brief conversation before beginning the assessment procedures. Once the student is familiar
with the process and the examiner, less rapport building is necessary.
Picture Support
The preschool NLM Listening stories have been illustrated to support the story retelling of students
who cannot otherwise retell a scoreable story. For example, 3-year-old students or students with
disabilities may have significant challenges retelling stories. To reduce the cognitive and memory
demands for these students, examiners can choose to use the picture booklet. However, it is
important to understand that pictures are not a permanent part of the NLM Listening. We encourage
the use of pictures temporarily for students whose language is monitored regularly and who receive
intervention. When student’s language improves sufficiently, the pictures should be withdrawn.
Administration Time
Administration time can vary greatly depending on the subtests administered and the performance
of the student. The DDM can be a very quick assessment, especially if a student meets benchmark
expectations on the highest targets assessed. Other times, the DDM can take up to 15 minutes
if a student struggles with each target in each measure. Each NLM Listening and NLM Reading
benchmark and progress monitoring assessment takes less than 5 minutes to administer, yet
administration time depends on grade level and the student’s fluency. Scoring can be done in real-
time while the student is retelling the story to the examiner. Scoring can also be done by listening
to an audio recording or by referencing a transcript of the student’s story. Because the CUBED-3
provides information that can directly inform instruction, additional assessments many not need to be
administered prior to differentiated instruction. This can save educators considerable time.
NLM and ELM Flowchart
Personal oral and written stories and expository language samples elicited using the NLM Listening
and NLM Reading are scored using the NLM Flowchart (Appendix A) or the ELM Flowchart (Appendix
B). In addition, any story or expository language sample elicited from a child can be scored using the
flowcharts (e.g., a retell from a children’s story book, a personal story recorded in an exchange with
a peer, a written story from a teacher prompt, an explanation on how to build something). The NLM
and ELM Flowcharts use a flow chart approach to assign a numerical score that quantify the extent
to which oral and written stories and exposition are comprised of essential features. The flowcharts
are detailed and designed to measure subtle changes in children’s expressive language over time.
Examiners begin at the top of the flowchart for each element measured, and then move downward
answering yes/no questions until they reach the student’s present level of performance. We specifically
selected the flowchart items based on their relevance to the state educational standards, their
relevance to narration and exposition, and their relevance to academic language, which is necessary
for academic success.

written personal narrative generation, which facilitates the examination of transcription and oral and
written expressive language across different modalities. The Narrative language measures also uses a
very brief dynamic assessment of language that can be administered to students who are not meeting
benchmark expectations. This dynamic assessment of language helps examiners determine whether
poor performance on the NLM is due to a language learning difficulty or an extraneous factor.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: NLM
Administration and scoring for all but the personal generation subtests of the NLM can be done in
real-time, either by hand, or via a digital device using the Insight system. NLM Listening forms have
six different levels of complexity: preschool, kindergarten, first, second, and third grade. NLM Reading
forms are written for eight different levels (first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth
grade). To the extent possible, these levels are based on developmental patterns and curriculum
expectations for narrative structure, language complexity, and decoding skills.
First and second grade NLM Reading passages include an initial decodable section that allows for the
measurement of decoding fluency using syllable types, temporarily and permanently irregularly spelled
words, and affixes most often taught prior to that particular period of time in the school year. Because
these sections are decodable, examiners can infer that if a student meets benchmark expectations for
decoding fluency (CWPM) and accuracy, that student can decode most words with the syllable types
and patterns taught to most students prior to that time point in the school year. This means that it may
not be necessary to administer additional measures related to word recognition if those benchmarks
are met (e.g., Decoding Inventory, Phonemic Awareness, Letter Sounds, Irregular Words etc.). Because
of this careful engineering of passages, the CUBED-3 assessment can be very efficient for those
students who meet benchmark expectations on Decoding Fluency and Accuracy. The guidelines in
tables 2-7 were used to write the decodable sections for first grade NLM Reading (~ first 50 words)
and second grade NLM Reading (~ first 90 words).
For benchmark assessments, students are administered the NLM grade level that corresponds with
their grade. For progress monitoring, any grade level can be administered to any student according to
their current level of performance.
Stories used in the administration of the NLM Listening and NLM Reading are realistic fiction focusing
on themes that are personably relatable to young students. We have chosen the context of personal-
themed narrative discourse to assess language development. Personal narration is typically used to
communicate with others about past events, and it is one of the more complex forms of discourse.
We expect young students to tell far less organized and less linguistically complex stories than older
students, and students who have language difficulty tend to have significant difficulty with narration.
The developmental nature of narration, its ability to tax a student’s language system, and the fact
that most students across many cultures commonly use narration to communicate make it quite
useful for language assessment. Our choice to use personal-themed narratives has much to do with
their ubiquity in children’s functional daily communication, their utility for standardized elicitation,
and their potential to reflect culturally universal themes. Each narrative also includes a main idea
and two supporting details that creates a hybrid narrative/expository passage, allowing for a basic
measurement of the comprehension and production of expository language.
In addition to the personal nature of NLM stories, their design has been strategically grounded in
curriculum-based measurement conventions. To inform educational decisions regarding children’s
language needs, it is imperative that their language is sampled repeatedly over time in a standardized
format. This means that several alternate forms of the assessment need to be available. NLM stories
undergo extensive scrutiny to ensure that they have consistent lengths, story structure, sentence
complexity, and vocabulary complexity. The stories are an essential feature of the NLM and promote
a standardized, reliable, and valid assessment of language comprehension and production. The
following is an overview of the NLM sections.

SECOND GRADE (EOY) Decodable Parameters (red font)
BOY Benchmark 1 Decodable Section (88 words)
On Saturday, Jacob, who loved the outdoors, was fishing with his grandpa at a nearby river delta. The triangle-
shaped piece of land, which formed when the fresh water of the river flowed into the salty water of the ocean, was
their favorite place to fish. Jacob tried to cast the line into the brackish water, but his line snagged in a tree behind
him. Jacob panicked and thought he could just pull the line free. But when Jacob whipped the line hard, it got
caught even worse!
BOY Benchmark 2 Decodable Section (84 words)
Last week, Luiz went outside to feed his pet goats. His goats, which are called Fainting goats, are very friendly.
However, when they get scared, their legs get stiff, and they fall over. When Luiz poured some grain into their
feeder, he noticed there was only one goat in the pen. The other goat had escaped and was eating some thick,
overgrown bushes in the backyard. Luiz felt worried because he didn’t know how he would catch the goat that
always ran from him.

Direct Measure of: Decoding, Word Recognition
Construct
Measured Indirect Measure of: Reading Comprehension
This subtest primarily relates to the word recognition strand in Scarborough’s reading
model and reflects the Decoding and Signt Recognition subskills. Fluency, particularly
prosody, can be an indicator of how well a student understands the text.
Construct • Fluency is necessary, but not sufficient, for understanding the meaning of text
Significance “When children read too slowly or haltingly, the text devolves into a broken string of words
and/or phrases; it’s a struggle just to remember what’s been read, much less extract its
meaning. So it’s important that teachers determine if their students’ fluency is at a level
appropriate for their grade.” -Jan Hasbrouck
• Fluent readers can focus their attention on what the text means
Fluent readers can decode with automaticity, converting the written code to language.
Consequently, if the student can understand the language being decoded, then reading
comprehension happens.
• Less fluent readers must focus more of their attention on decoding, leaving them
less attention for understanding the meaning of text
Construct • Primarily relates to decoding and word recognition
Connections “The relationship between correct words per minute and comprehension has been found to
be stronger in the elementary and junior high grades than in older students” (Fuchs et al.,
2001)
Assessment Benchmark Expectations for:
Schedule BOY First Grade to EOY Eighth Grade
Time 1 minute. This is a timed test.
Prompts • “Please read this out loud. Do your very best reading. I’ll help you if you need it.
When you’re done I’m going to ask you to tell me the exact same story, and I’m
going to ask you some questions. Are you ready?”
• Corrective Prompt: Do not let the student skip a line.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: NLM
Scoring Paper/Pencil:
Overview While student is reading, put a
slash ( / ) through incorrect words
(mispronunciations, substitutions,
skipped words). If student fails
to correctly read a word after 3
seconds, say the word and mark as
incorrect. Self-corrections within 3
seconds, repetitions, and insertions
are not errors. Do not let student
skip a line. After 1 minute, place a
bracket ( ] ) after last word read.
After the student is finished
reading, complete the Reading
Fluency scoring section:
Insight:
While student is reading, click on
incorrect words (mispronunciations,
substitutions, skipped words).
If student fails to correctly read
a word after 3 seconds, say the
word and mark as incorrect. Self-
corrections within 3 seconds,
repetitions, and insertions are not
errors. Do not let student skip a
line. After 1 minute, click on the last
word read.
After the student is finished
reading, insight will calculate
Decoding Fluency and Accuracy
automatically.
The examiner will need to complete
the Prosody Rating scale.
Wait Rule If student fails to correctly read a word after 3 seconds, say the word and mark as incorrect.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: NLM
Discontinue • Have student stop reading after 1 minute. Place a bracket after the last word read.
Rule Examiner reads the remainder of the passage.
• If student makes 7 or more errors in the first 10 words, ask student to stop reading.
Examiner reads the entire passage from the beginning.
What is Before:
Administered • BOY first grade to EOY eighth grade, this is usually the first subtest administered.
Before and
After:
After?
• Administer the NLM Reading Retell and NLM Questions, and if desired, the NLM Personal
Writing Generation (optional).
• If student is not at benchmark on Decoding Fluency (number of words read correct in one
minute), administer the second NLM Reading. Examiners can choose to only administer
the 1 minute reading fluency section on the NLM Reading second benchmark subtest if
the NLM Reading Retell and NLM Questions were at benchmark on the first NLM Reading
Benchmark subtest.
• DDM Decoding subtests can be administered to obtain additional information on a
student’s word identification-related skills.
• The Rapid Automatized Naming and Dynamic Assessment of Decoding subtests from the
PEARL and DYMOND can help identify students who have dyslexia.
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts
for examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every
time.
• This is a timed test. Student has 1 minute to read a part of the passage.
• Count 3 seconds (e.g., one one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand) in your
mind when waiting for a student to read a word. After 3 seconds, say the word for the
student.
• After 1 minute, ask the student to stop reading. Read the remainder of the passage,
starting at the beginning of the last sentence read.
• Do not let the student skip a row.
• If student begins to read from top to bottom, or points randomly, say, “Go this way” and
move your finger from left to right along the row. This reminder can only be given one time.
• If a student stops and it appears that they are not certain if they should continue, say
“keep going”. Say as often as necessary.
• If student loses their place, point to where they left off to help them find their place in the
row. Do this as often as necessary.
• Benchmark expectations are available in this manual.
• If a student is not at benchmark on the first decoding fluency passage, administer a
second decoding fluency passage.
• Only score the words read up to the 1 minute mark.
• Record Response Patterns and take additional notes as needed.
• Schwa sound (the ‘uh’ sound) are not counted as errors.
• Self-corrections within 3 seconds are not counted as errors.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.

• Over 40 years of research indicate that there is a strong relationship between
receptive language and reading comprehension. “It can be reasonably argued that
learning to read enables a person to comprehend written language to the same level
he or she comprehends spoken language.” (Rayner et al, 2001, p. 42).

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: NLM
Prompts • NLM Reading: “Thanks for reading and listening. Now you tell me that exact same
story. Try to include as many details as you can in your story.”
• NLM Listening*: “Thanks for listening. Now you tell me that exact same story. Try to
include as many details as you can in your story.”
*If the NLM Reading was not administered prior to the NLM Listening, administer the
primer story provided on each NLM Listening form. Say, “I’m going to tell you a story.
When I’m done, I’m going to ask you to tell me the entire story. I’m also going to ask
you some questions, so please listen very carefully. Are you ready?” Then read the
primer story to the student.
After reading the primer story, say, “Thanks for listening. Now you tell me that exact
same story. Try to include as many details as you can in your story.” This retell is not
scored.
After the student retells the story, ask the factual and inferential questions provided
(e.g., “How did Pablo fix the problem?” “What do you think the weather was like?”
“Why?”). The examiner should give the student the answer to these questions if they
answer them incorrectly or incompletely.
After the primer story has been retold and the student has answered the questions, say,
“Now I’m going to tell you an even longer story. When I’m done, I’m going to ask you
to tell me the entire story. I’m also going to ask you some questions, so please listen
very carefully. Are you ready?”
• Prompt: When it appears student is done retelling, say, “Are you finished?”
• Corrective Prompt (as often as necessary): “Just tell me the story with the parts you
remember.”
• Corrective Prompt (one time): If it appears the student isn’t telling a story, say,
“Remember, tell it to me like a story.”
Scoring Scoring Instructions:
Overview • While student is retelling the story, score the Narrative Discourse Complexity (story
grammar; NDC) and the Expository Discourse Complexity (EDC) sections in real-time.
Some examiners may be able to score the Sentence Complexity and Vocabulary
Complexity sections in real-time, while the student is retelling, but many examiners
choose to rely on an audio recording to score those parts of the subtest.
• Student receives 2 points for complete and clear inclusion of the story grammar elements,
1 point for unclear or poorly specified elements, and 0 points for omitting an element.
Students also receive 1 point for the main idea and 1 points each for the two supporting
details from the expository information embedded in the narrative. When student is done
retelling, continue to NLM Questions section.
• When NLM Retell and NLM Questions subtests have been administered, listen to audio
to review real-time scores for the NDC and EDC sections and use the audio recording to
score the Sentence Complexity and Vocabulary Complexity sections.
• Students receive 1 point for the inclusion of the sentence complexity targets listed on the

Discontinue • When it appears the student is done retelling the story, the examiner says, “Are you
Rule finished?”
• Prompts: Neutral comments to help motivate (e.g., “Wow!” “Oh!”; “Uhmm”; “OK”). Be
engaged with the student as they are retelling the story. Pay attention and create an
authentic storytelling context. Do not ask specific questions such as “Why did he do
that?” or “What did he do?” or “What happened next?”
• Acceptable prompt: “Just tell me the story with the parts your remember.”
• Acceptable prompt*: If the student doesn’t appear to be telling a story, say, “Remember,
tell it to me like a story.”
*For example, some students will start their retell by saying something like “He was mad and he got hurt so
he got…” The examiner should interrupt the student and say “Remember, tell it to me like a story.”
What is Before:
Administered • NLM Reading: Decoding Fluency is typically administered prior to the Reading Retell.
Before and • NLM Listening: For first grade and higher, the NLM Reading is typically administered
After? prior to the administration of the NLM Listening.
After:
• The NLM Questions (Factual (F), Inferential Vocabulary (IV), and Inferential Reasoning
(IR) are administered after the retell. Personal Writing Generation should be probed at
intervals.
• If student is not at benchmark on the first NLM Reading Retell benchmark form,
administer the second NLM Reading Retell benchmark form. If the student is still not at
benchmark after administration of the second NLM Reading Retell, administer the NLM
Listening Benchmark.
• If there are concerns that a student has a language disorder, administer the narrative
language subtest of the PEARL (for preschool and kindergarten students) or the DYMOND
(for first grade and older students)

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: NLM
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• AI transcription and scoring can be used.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts for
examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every time.
• Examiner may not repeat the story or any part of it, but can repeat the directions and
provide encouragement as needed.
• (If pictures are used for preschool students) Examiner lays out the picture book on the
table in front of the child. Examiner points to each picture in sequence while reading the
story. Examiner leaves pictures in front of student while the student is retelling the story.
• Examiner reads the selected story word for word in a moderate pace with normal inflection.
• When the student is reading the passage, if the character’s name is read incorrectly, tell
the student the name of the character the first time they read it incorrectly. Count the first
incorrect character name as a word read incorrectly. If the student continues to read the
character name incorrectly, count it as an error.
• When administering the Reading Retell, be sure to remove the student passage when the
student is retelling the story and answering questions about the story.
• This is not a timed subtest (the preceding Reading Fluency section is timed).
• Benchmark expectations are available in this manual.
• If a student is not at benchmark on the first and second Reading Retell, administer an
NLM Listening Retell.
• Take additional notes as needed.
• Use the audio recording to check for accuracy and to score any items that were not
scored in real-time.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.
Specific Specific NLM Retell scoring information
Scoring • To be scored, the child’s utterances do not need to match the samples in the scoring
Guidelines block word for word; however, they should contain the same amount of correct
for the NLM information. The sample utterances were drawn directly from the stories themselves and
Retell from transcripts of students who have retold those stories previously. When in doubt,
examiners should reference the general scoring guidelines and use clinical judgment to
assign the best score.
Narrative Discourse Complexity (NDC) scoring information
• To earn 2 points, the utterance should be able to stand-alone. The scorer should not need
to have shared knowledge of the story to correctly interpret the utterance. If inference is
necessary to know what the student meant, the score should not be a 2. Students are
awarded 2 points for Character even if they use an incorrect character name. This is the
only story grammar element that is awarded 2 points when the information is incorrect. All
other story grammar elements should be accurate, complete, and clear to be awarded full
points.
• 1 point responses are scored when students have some key words or a phrase, but it is
not specific and clear enough to stand-alone.
• When students do not include a story grammar component in their retell, that category
receives 0 points. Sometimes students will include false information that they use to
embellish the story. If the embellishments did not occur in the story and change the
meaning of the story content, then 0 points should be awarded.

Specific Sentence Complexity (SC) scoring information
Scoring • In the Sentence Complexity section, students earn 1 point for every use of different
Guidelines subordinating conjunctions such as because, so-that, when, while, after, before, since,
for the NLM however, although, even though, and relative pronouns which follow a noun such as rolls
Retell that, popovers which, and sister who.
• Students are allowed up to three points for each different word. In contrast, multiple uses
of the word then earns students no extra points.
• 1 point is the total possible for the use of then (only applicable to the NLM Preschool).
• The Sentence Complexity section of the NLM is designed to quickly and easily
document the extent to which there is evidence that a student uses more cmplex
academic language. The limited number of words available to choose from (e.g., when,
after, because, noun-who, noun-that) were carefully selected because of their relative
importance in academic language (reflecting causal and temporal relations and relative
subordination), and to simplify the scoring process for those examiners who are less
familiar with language assessment and analysis.
• If an examiner is particularly comfortable analyzing a student’s language complexity
at a more detailed level, then some exceptions from the standardized procedures are
acceptable. For example, if a student were to use an adverbial subordinate clause
with the subordinating conjunction ‘whilst’ instead of ‘when’, it would be acceptable to
give the student credit for using ‘when’ because of their similar linguistic function. The
following list of words, if used in subordinating clauses, could be used as substitutes for
the limited selection of words provided on the Sentence Complexity section, however,
we reiterate that attending to this list of words is not necessary, and should only be
attempted by advanced examiners.

• now that • unless • (noun) where
Vocabulary Complexity (VC) scoring information
• In the Vocabulary Complexity section, students earn 1 point for the inclusion in their
retell of one of the words listed. There are two spaces where the examiner can write in
additional tier-2 words, awarding a student up to two additional points for including tier-2
words not found in the model text. Tier-2 words are high frequency words used by mature
language users across several content areas. Examples of teir-2 words include secured,
scrambled, exasperated, bewildered.
Calculating Listening Retell Score
• The Listening Retell Score and the Reading Retell Score are comprised of the Narrative
Discourse Complexity (NDC) subtotal, the Expository Discourse Complexity (EDC)
subtotal, the Sentence Complexity (SC) subtotal, the Vocabulary Complexity (VC) subtotal,
and the Episode Complexity subtotal(s).

Measured © 2T02h3 Liasngu asgeu Dybnatmeicss Grto upp, LrLCim. | a wrwiwl.Lyan grueagelDayntaemicssG rtouop.c otmhe Language Comprehension strand in Scarborough’s
reading model and reflects the Background Knowledge and Verbal Reasoning strands.
Construct • The NLM Questions section measures several distinct skills; the ability to recall
Significance factual information, the ability to infer the meaning of unfamiliar words from context,
and the ability to draw inferences from text and from background knowledge.
• Language sampling analysis through retelling can tell us a lot about a student’s
receptive and expressive language, but it doesn’t cover everything.
• Students learn the meanings of most words indirectly, through inference
“Most students acquire vocabulary incidentally through indirect exposure to words at
home and at school—by listening and talking, by listening to books read aloud to them,
and by reading widely on their own.” -Cunningham and Stanovich (1998)
• Previous research has shown that children with comprehension difficulties are poor
at inference making (e.g., Cain & Oakhill, 1999; Oakhill, 1982, 1984).
• Text-to-Text and Elaborative Inferencing are necessary for higher-order thinking and
are needed across the curriculum
Inference making is regarded as a central component of skilled reading. Less skilled
readers do not generate as many inferences as more skilled readers do.
• Text-to-text and elaborative inferencing are conceptually distinct and serve different
functions in the construction of a text representation
Poor comprehenders have difficulty generating both types of inference, relative to their
skilled peers.

Construct • Vocabulary directly affects reading comprehension. Students who havea more
Connections limited vocabulary tend to have low comprehension.
• Students with low vocabulary scores tend to have low comprehension and students
with satisfactory or high vocabulary scores tend to have satisfactory or high
comprehension scores.”
Vocabulary plays a fundamental role in the reading process, and contributes greatly to a
reader’s comprehension. A reader cannot understand a text without knowing what most
of the words mean.
• Making inferences during reading is a critical standards-based skill and is important
for reading comprehension.
Students with higher levels of inference skill score higher on tests of reading
comprehension than do students with low levels of inference skill.
Assessment BOY Preschool to EOY Eighth Grade
Schedule
Time Varies by student response. Approximately 3-4 minutes to administer Factual Questions,
Inferential Vocabulary, and Inferential Reasoning.
Prompts The question can be repeated one time if necessary. Do not wait longer than 10 seconds for
a student to respond before asking them if they would like the sentence repeated.
Scoring Factual (F):
Overview • Ask the students the questions word for word as written on the NLM form.
• Students receive 2 points for complete and clear answers and 1 point for incomplete or
incorrect answers, following the same scoring guidelines used for the Narrative Discourse
Complexity and Expository Discourse Complexity sections scored for the student’s retell.
• If the student received 2 points on any of the narrative discourse elements during their
retell, specific questions about those elements do not need to be asked in the Factual
Questions section, and 2 points should be awarded for those questions.
For example, if a student retold the story and included the character’s name (2 points
for Character) and included a complete and clear problem (2 points for Problem), then
the factual question “Who was the story about?” and the factual question “Why was
[character name and their emotion]?” do not need to be asked and the student should be
given 2 points for each of those questions. Insight will automatically assign those scores
in the Factual Questions section for the examiner.

Dynamic Assessment Procedures NLM Questions: Factual (F)
Construct Language Learning Ability
Measured This subtest primarily relates to the Language Comprehension strand in Scarborough’s
reading model and reflects underlying language learning ability, which affects all aspects of
the strands.
Construct The ability to learn language can be used a general outcome measure that will help assess
Significance a student’s ability to understand and produce complex academic language across multiple
contexts.
Construct First Grade through Third Grade NLM Reading Benchmark 2 – BOY, MOY, and EOY. This
Connections dynamic assessment is typically only administered to students who do not meet benchmark
expectations on the first NLM Reading Benchmark Retell and who are consequently
administered the second NLM Reading benchmark.
This dynamic assessment task is automated in the Insight system.
Time Varies by student response. Approximately 3 minutes to administer the Factual (F) section
with the teaching phases.
Prompt For each question that the student receives a 0 or 1 score, story-specific prompts are
followed word for word. The first model sentence can be repeated if the student requests.
Scoring The student’s ability to repeat the model sentences is not scored, yet examiners can
take notes if desired. After the Factual Questions with the teaching script has been
administered, the examiner completes a Responsiveness scale to characterize the
student’s ability to learn language. This responsiveness scale provides scores for this
dynamic assessment. This rating scale requires the examiner to reflect on the student’s
behavior during the teaching scripts and to make an overall judgment of the student’s ability
to learn language. After the Responsiveness scoring has been completed, the examiner
administers the Inferential Vocabulary and Inferential Reasoning sections.

Scoring Inferential Vocabulary (IV):
Overview There are A and B questions that can be asked. The examiner always asks Question A (e.g.,
“The woman was attentive. She knew where her class was. What does attentive mean?”).
Question B is asked if the student gets Question A wrong.
• If a student answers Question A clearly and completely, they are awarded 3 points.
• If the student answers Question A unclearly or incompletely (but is generally correct or
gets the general idea), then they are awarded 2 points.
• Some of the text in Question A is a grey color. This should not be omitted from the
question. If a student answers Question A using wording similar to what is in grey text,
say “What else does ______mean?”
• If the student answers Question A incorrectly, then they are asked Question B, and are
awarded 1 or 0 points according to whether they answered correctly or not.
• Students cannot receive points for Question A and Question B.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: NLM
Scoring Inferential Reasoning:
Overview Ask the students the questions word for word as written on the NLM form. Always ask the
follow up question “Why do you think that?” The first two questions for kindergarten through
third grade require inferencing from information provided in the narrative (within the text).
• Students are awarded 2 points if they make a clear and complete logical inference that
should have been derived from the specific story. The stories are designed to prompts
specific inferences. Students are awarded 1 point if the inference is clear and complete,
but not necessary the more obvious, logical inference that should be derived from the
clues in the story.
• The follow up question “Why do you think that?” should be answered using information
from the story. Students are awarded 1 point for referencing information from the text to
support their inference.
• There is a scoring guide under Specific Scoring Procedures (below) that can guide
the Inferential Reasoning scoring. The possible answers provided in the guide are not
comprehensive, and examiners should use personal judgement as to whether the student
has made a logical inference.
• The final inferential question for kindergarten through third grade is an elaborative
inferencing question that requires a student to use their background knowledge to answer
the question.

Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts
for examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every
time.
• This is not a timed portion of the test but keep the assessment moving forward. Do not
wait excessively long for answers (<10 seconds).
• There are benchmarks for the NLM Questions.
• Take additional notes as needed.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.

One day, Scott was trying to skateboard at the big park near his house. Scott was not having
fun because he kept tumbling off his brand-new skateboard. He was constantly getting hurt,
even though he was wearing protective gear that he put on his elbows and knees. The gear was
supposed to keep him safe. Scott was really frustrated. He desperately wanted to skateboard
without getting hurt, which seemed impossible to do. He finally decided to ask his nice, big
brother, who was also at the park, for help. He said, “I don’t know how to skateboard. Can you
please help me learn how to skateboard because I keep falling down?” Then Scott’s helpful
brother said, “Sure! I can teach you. When you start going, quickly clasp my hand.” After he held
his brother’s hand, Scott finally learned to balance on the skateboard. He diligently practiced for
the rest of the day. He was happy because he didn’t fall anymore.

Yesterday morning, Jen quietly walked into the kitchen. She got up early so that she could make
for the NLM breakfast for her mom. When Jen saw her dad in the kitchen, she asked him to help her make
Retell breakfast. But sadly, her dad was in a hurry. Jen was disappointed because she needed some
help. She wanted to make fresh, delicious popovers, which are her mom’s favorite breakfast.
Popovers are fluffy rolls that are baked in muffin tins. They are made with lots of eggs and butter.
Jen decided to try to bake the popovers independently. She found the recipe. But she quickly
grew frustrated because she couldn’t understand the convoluted instructions. She decided to
wake up her sister, who was a fabulous cook. Jen hesitantly woke her sister up. She whispered,
“Will you please help me make mom’s special breakfast?” Although Jen’s sister was very
fatigued, she immediately said, “I forgot what day it is. I’ll be right there to help you.” After Jen
and her sister cooked the breakfast, she was happy since she got to prepare her mom a special

Construct • The NLM Personal Writing Generation and Personal (Story) Generation subtests
Significance measure a student’s ability to produce complex academic language in oral or
written form.
• Narrative language samples elicited through personal story generation (oral or
written) can reveal a significant amount of information about expressive academic

Construct • Applying academic language skills to oral and written personal story generation is
Connections crucial for academic success.
Assessment BOY Preschool to EOY Eighth Grade
Schedule
Time Personal Generation usually takes about 1 minute. Audio record the student’s personal story
and use the NLM Flowchart (in the appendices) to score the student’s story.
Personal Writing Generation can be administered to a group of students. Students should
be given approximately 10 minutes to complete the Personal Writing Generation subtest.
Use the NLM Flowchart (in the appendices) to score the student’s written language.
Prompts • NLM Listening (Personal Generation): Say, “In this story______. Tell me story about a
time when ________.” Use the script provided for each specific NLM Listening form to fill
in the blanks.
• NLM Reading (Personal Writing Generation): Give the student the NLM Writing Form.
Say, “In this story______. Write a story about a time when ________.” Use the script
provided for each specific NLM Reading form to fill in the blanks.
• Prompt: Encourge the student (up to three times) to produce a related story*.
*If necessary, examiners can encourage the student to tell a story about a more general
theme (e.g., getting hurt or getting lost). The student’s story does not have to include the
same specific problem presented in the model story used to elicit the retell.
• NLM Listening Prompts: Neutral comments to help motivate (e.g., “Wow!” “Oh!”;
“Uhmm”; “OK”). Be engaged with the student as they are telling their personal
story. Pay attention and create an authentic storytelling context. Do not ask specific
questions such as “Why did he do that?” or “What did he do?” or “What happened next?”
• NLM Reading Prompts: Neutral comments to help motivate (e.g., “Do you best writing.”
“Wow!” “Oh!”; “Uhmm”; “OK”). Do not ask specific questions such as “Why did he do
that?” or “What did he do next?”

Scoring NLM Listening Personal Generation: Audio record the student’s personal story generation.
Overview Use the NLM Flow Chart to score the story (available in the appendices).
NLM Reading Personal Writing Generation: If the student has poor transcription skills
(hand writing), ask the student what the illegible words are, or if necessary, ask the student
to read or dictate their story to you. Write down what the student says on the Student NLM
Writing Form. Use the NLM Flow Chart to score the story (available in the appendices).

What is Before:
Administered • NLM Questions is typically administered prior to the NLM Personal Writing or the NLM
Before and Personal Story Generation sections.
After?
After:
• Administer the language subtest of the PEARL or the DYMOND if there are concerns for
language disorder.
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts
for examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every
time.
• This is not a timed portion of the test.
• There are no benchmarks for the Personal Generation and Personal Writing Generation.
• Take additional notes as needed.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: NLM
Specific Eliciting a Story Without Using the NLM
Scoring Prior to eliciting a narrative, the examiner should select a story (or stories) to elicit. Narrative
Guidelines retells should be elicited using equivalent model stories whenever possible, especially if
for the NLM the purpose of assessment is progress monitoring. The same model story should not be
Personal used with a child more than once. To elicit a personal or fictional story generation, the
Writing examiner should provide a prompt for the child (e.g., “Tell me a story about a time when you
Generation were really scared”). The same story prompt should be used multiple times if the purpose
and the NLM of assessment is progress monitoring. Story generation prompts should be designed to
Personal elicit a narrative that has a complete episode (a problem/initiating event, attempt, and
Story consequence). There are many experiences children across different cultures share,
Generation including losing an item, getting hurt, being scared etc. Prompts that revolve around general
personal themes such as these often elicit excellent stories to which all children can relate.
Eliciting a Story Using the NLM
Each NLM Listening and NLM Reading form includes a section that prompts the generation
of personal oral or written narratives. These sections are supplemental. They were designed
to measure generalized oral and written academic language growth. To elicit an oral or
written personal story using the NLM, a student is first asked to complete an NLM Listening
or NLM Reading narrative retell. After a student has retold the personal-themed NLM
narrative, the examiner follows the elicitation script at the bottom of each NLM form, which
prompts the student to generate an oral or written personal narrative that is thematically
related to the story just retold.
The NLM and ELM Flow Charts
Personal oral and written stories and expository language samples elicited using the NLM
are scored using the NLM Flowchart (Appendix A) or the ELM Flowchart (Appendix B). In
addition, any story or expository language sample elicited from a child can be scored using
these scoring guides (e.g., a retell from a children’s story book, a personal story recorded
in an exchange with a peer, a written story from a teacher prompt, an explanation on how
to build something). The NLM and ELM Flowcharts use a flow chart approach to assign a
numerical score that quantifies the extent to which oral and written stories and exposition
are comprised of essential features. The flowchart is detailed and is designed to sensitively
measure subtle changes in children’s language over time. Examiners begin at the top
of the flow chart for each element measured, and then move downward answering yes/
no questions until they reach the student’s present level of performance. We specifically
selected the flow chart items based on their relevance to state educational standards, their
relevance to narration and exposition, and their relevance to academic language.
There are three major sections in the NLM and ELM Flowcharts: 1) sentence complexity
with indices of vocabulary and grammar, 2) story/passage structure which provides
information on story/passage clarity and completeness and 3) writing conventions with
indices of punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Specific information on how to score
each section follows.

Distinguishing Noun Modifiers from Two-word Nouns
Noun modifiers must add sensory or qualitative information.
Descriptive information written before nouns sometimes contains categorical information,
which classifies nouns based on their use. Such words create two-word nouns.
To identify a two-word noun, ask yourself if…
• The two words are frequently used together, and
• They are both necessary to identify the noun being referenced.
If you can answer “yes” to these questions, then it is a two-word noun. Such descriptors
should not count as noun modifiers.

SETTING EXAMPLE
“Last night I walked upstairs to my room. (...)”
Reference to time Reference to activity Reference to location
** can not count towards 2 or 3 point score (if activity and/or location are also present)
STORIES WITH NO PROBLEM (OR IMPLIED PROBLEMS)
• Samples that only describe activities without a clear problem/issue that the main
character encounters can be awarded points for setting.
“Um he has his backpack. Then he put he come fo his jacket. Then when he put his jacket, he goes to school
and learn what the when in his t-shirt. (...) and he says he change and when he when he finish early, he go
back to the house and brush his teeth and go to sleep.”
SETTING = 2 POINTS (activity + location)
EPISODE • A story episode is a complete story cycle.
COMPLEXITY
• The next 4 narrative structure elements we will study contribute to Episodic Complexity.
These are:
1. Problem 2. Plan/Attempt 3. Consequence 4. Ending
Remember from before... the EXCLUSIVITY RULE:
• A targeted speech segment can count towards only one of these four narrative structure
elements.
• If you aren’t sure which category a speech segment should count for, default to one of
these four categories.

NARRATIVE DISCOURSE
PLAN/ • Action performed by main or secondary character
ATTEMPT
• An attempt to solve the problem
• Directly causes the consequence
EXAMPLES
• He asked his dad for help.
• She closed her eyes and tried to sleep.
• The mother changed the baby’s diaper.
EXAMPLE IN CONTEXT
“Nina couldn’t see the dog man book in the picture so she went to the she went to the
eye doctor and her vision wasn’t so well. So she got glasses that right her her and she
liked them so she put them on and she felt happy to get glasses so she could see the
dog man book that she’s reading. And uh she could she could see clearly again and see
she grade so she can have good good grade good grades and stuff.”
SCORE: 3 (one complete and clear plan/attempt)
CONSEQUENCE • Direct result of the attempt to solve the problem
• Caused by the plan/attempt, even if a plan/attempt is not explicit
• Can be actions by any character or no character at all
EXAMPLES
• He found his missing shoe in the toy castle.
• When she woke up, she felt better.
• The baby stopped crying.
• It started to feel better.

NARRATIVE DISCOURSE
2+ PLAN/ • Samples containing more than one problem (P) or plan/attempt (PL/A) should be
ATTEMPTS AND awarded 4 points in the appropriate category.
CONSEQUENCES
- Separate problems or plan/attempts must be distinct in order to be awarded 4 points!
• In order to receive 4 points for consequence (C), there must be more than one
problem, or more than one plan/attempt that the consequence relates to.
- Some samples contain a cluster of consequences related to only one plan/attempt.
Such samples should receive a score of 3 for consequence.
EXAMPLE IN CONTEXT
“So Hannah had a had a pain in her mouth (P) and she tried making it better (A) but
when she tried it wouldn’t work (C). So she went to the dentist (A) and the dentist found
out there’s something stuck between her teeth and got it out (C).”
SCORE: 1 Problem (P) = 3 points
2 plan/attempts (PL/A) = 4 points
2 consequences (C) = 4 points
Conservative Rule Application
• Sometimes it is difficult to tell if something should be scored as an attempt/
consequence or as consequence/ending.
• For example, deciding between these two options:
- Option 1: The boy dropped his popsicle (P), his mom gave him another one (C) and
then he ate it before it melted (E)
- Option 2: The boy dropped his popsicle(P), his mom gave him another one(P/A) and
then he ate it before it melted(C)
• When faced with this type of decision, first identify other elements in the story that can
be scored. For example, if “then he thanked his mom for the popsicle” came at the
end of this story, this would count as an ending. Option 2 would be a better choice for
scoring because there is other content that can complete the episode.
• However, if there are not additional story components, then you must choose the most
conservative category with the most conservative score. In Option 1, there is no clear
attempt, but it can be assumed that if it was explicit, it would have been that the child
asked his mom for another popsicle. The content is more clearly consequence and
ending (in absence of other information) and receives the lower score (3, 3, 2) than
Option 2 (3, 3, 3). Therefore, it is the most conservative choice.
ENDING • Complete and clear ending to the story
EXAMPLE IN CONTEXT
“Nina couldn’t see the dog man book in the picture so she went to the she went to the
eye doctor and her vision wasn’t so well. So she got glasses that right her her and she
liked them so she put them on and she felt happy to get glasses so she could see the
dog man book that she’s reading. And uh she could she could see clearly again and see
she grade so she can have good good grade good grades and stuff.”
SCORE: 2 (complete and clear) *Note, there are multiple endings but they only count as
2 points.

Irrelevant and Unscorable Examples
• I love flowers.
• I see in the picture.
• You said that …
• I’ll say it’s an otter.
• I like eating strawberries and blueberries and I like to make toast.
When scoring:
• Count each information unit ONLY ONCE, even if the content is repeated.

INFORMATION Helpful tips
UNITS
• Look for verbs. Verbs are critical to information units. You can never have an
information unit with an implied verb.
• Distinguish clauses (relative, subordinate, conditional, and main clauses) from phrases
that do not contain a verb (e.g. prepositional phrases)
• Do not include utterances directed to the examiner or to one’s self if they do not
include “information” about the topic.
• Do not count false starts, repetitions, and fractured phrases.
• Sometimes verbs (usually –ing) function as nouns (e.g., Exercising is good for you) so
make sure the verb is really the verb in that sentence.
• Infinitives (verbs preceded with “to”) count as long as they are adding new and
complete information. Keep in mind some verbs need direct objects to be complete.
• If/then statements containing a complete subject and verb count as two Information
Units. “If fish have gills,F1 then they can swing underwater for a long time. F2”
EXAMPLES
• …I milked a cow before N1, … but actually it was so funny the cow was like, “Get off my udder.”
N2 He tried to kick me,N3
• …if you’re accidentally lost F1 and you’re trynta survive F2, you might even run into a cougar F3,
you’re gonna have to flee F4 until it’s too tired.
• …soil is the food for the food for the flowers F1, and flowers always need water F2 and sun to
grow ( . . . ) that if they don’t have sun or water to grow F3 they can die F4. And one more thing. If
you water the plant too much, F5 they can die F6. Cuz one day I did it N1, and then my plant died
N2. It wasn’t good at all N3.
• My my tooth (was) about to fall out N1. My sister tooth already fall out N2. Her tooth fallN3 when
her chewing on something really hard N4. And now I one, two, three her tooth fall out N5.
• Um eat healthy and exercise. F1 And you have to eat what your mom packs me F2 like that or
that or that or that or that. That’s healthy P1 but this is not healthy. P2 And water’s healthy. F3
In this sample, when the child states an item on the card is healthy and another item is not
healthy, these are scored as Picture Information Units. When they then state that water is
healthy (without a reference to the picture), it is scored as a Factual Information Unit.
• In this one the crab walks on the sand. P1 Crabs can’t swim. F1
Similar to the previous example, the child initially refers to the card (“in this one”), which is
scored as a Picture Information Unit, then states that “crabs can’t swim” which is scored as a
Factual Information Unit.
• First you plant the dirt.1 Then you put in the water2 and give sunlight.3
Notice that use of “you” makes this factual because it is not about a specific event. It’s about
what typically happens and represents a “how to” exposition.
• Dolphins have gills.1 Some sharks have gills2 and crabs do not have gills.3
Even though dolphins don’t have gills, this is still scored as a factual statement.
• …in this picture it looks like they digged the ground 1 and they put a seed 2 and then they and
then they put the sand back where it belong 3 and then the the mushroom grow big. 4
• This one is big1 and that one is not big.2
• The elephant uses its trunk to splash its water on top of itF1 and then drinks water from there.F2
… and the lion is, can, uh can fight with other animals.F3 And, um, the bird uses its big um it big
mouth to eat to eat other little animals…F4
While the story card does contain a picture of an elephant, lion, and bird, the child does not
describe what is on each picture or directly reference the card. Therefore, the information is
scored as Factual Information Units.

INFORMATION
UNITS EXAMPLES OF DIFFICULT TO SCORE UNITS WITH LISTS (words in parentheses are the
subjects that do not need to be repeated)
• (They) can bounce F1 and swim F2.
– Scored like “They can bounce.” and “They can swim.”
• (A caterpillar) comes F1, then wraps itself up F2, and becomes a butterfly F3.
• There’s a way to protect the earth F1, to pick up trash F2, and to put it in the can F3.
– The subjects of each segment are not explicit, but because there is a verb in each segment,
and each segment provides unique information, they are information units.
– Scored like “There’s a way to protect the earth. You pick up trash. You put it in the can.”
• And you also, you can use like the chicken for its meat F1, because farmers have to eat that
sometimes F2 and fruit.
– In this sample, “and fruit” is not an information unit even though it is part of a list with the
subject in the stem. That is because it does not have a verb with it. It is just a noun.
*Not every type of list counts for information units so monitor the verbs!
EXAMPLES OF DIFFICULT TO SCORE UNITS WITH LISTS (words in parantheses are the
subjects that do not need to be repeated)
• Mushrooms could make spores F1 to send to see where is the best area for it for it to grow F2
and produce F3.
– The main clause is “mushrooms could make spores”, but the “to send” is a false start and the
“to see where is the best area” needs to have the endings “for it to grow” and “for it to produce”
to complete the information.
• The elephant uses its trunk to splash its water on top of it F1.
– The “to splash its water” and “on top of it” are prepositional phrases and do not constitute
independent information units.
– A way to check to see if the infinitive is a verb is delete the original verb and see if it makes
sense, “The elephant to splash its water.” and “The elephant on top of it.”
• Animals need mushrooms to eatF1 to survive F2.
– Scored like “Animals need mushrooms to eat.” and “Animals eat mushrooms to survive.”
*Not all infinitives function as verbs so double check they are verbs.

PASSAGE • Identify whether there is a common theme in which the Information Units support the
COHESION Main Idea.
• Process: Review the Information Units and Main idea scores for the passage to
determine the degree to which the child stays on topic. Annotate your decision making
process in green.
RULES
1. If there is a zero for Main Idea AND zero for Information Units, then Passage Cohesion
is automatically a zero.
If MI=0 + IU=0, then PC=0
1. If there is a zero for Main Idea, then the Passage Cohesion score can not = 3
If MI=0 then PC=0, 1, or 2
1. If there is a 1, 2, or 3 for Main Idea, then the Passage Cohesion score can not = 0 or 1
If MI=1, 2, or 3 then PC=2 or 3
2. Just describing each card individually without a common topic is scored as a 1.
CONCLUDING • Identify whether the passage contains a concluding statement or an attempt at a
STATEMENT concluding statement.
• Process: Read the entire passage, then go back and determine if the final sentence/
phrase summarizes – or attempts to summarize – the main idea for a majority of the
passage content. If it does, underline the corresponding section in blue.
EXAMPLES
• That’s why it’s important to clean up the earth.
• Those are all the kinds of animals that live in the jungle.
• That’s how the five senses all work together.
• That’s how we can stay healthy.
EXPOSITION • Exposition Types DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO TOTAL SCORE
TYPES
• Identify which of the six Exposition types best describes your sample and fill in the circle
for the corresponding category. If there are elements of multiple exposition types, fill in
more than one circle.
How To
• How To is a basic exposition type that explains to someone else how to do something. It
includes the use of “you” as the audience for the “how to” instruction.
• You have to take care of the world. You throw away trash and put plastic in the recycling. Or
you won’t have a good world.
• In this sample, the frequent use of “you” as the audience makes it clear it is a How To
exposition type.
Description
• Description describes events, items, beings or places in great detail.
• “Ocean animals are kind animals. Some are kind. Um they can be small ones, big ones, or
normal ones. They’re colorful. They live in the sea. Um thy eat other fishes and things and you
can find them at the beach if you you go really deep, like in a submarine down under.”

EXPOSITORY DISCOURSE
EXPOSITION
TYPES Sequence
• Sequence describes a specific order of something and includes words such as “first”, “next”,
“second”, or ”last.” These transition words signal sequenced material.
• “Butterflies and frogs go through the same … um something metamorphosis and then the
butterfly first is a this, and then it turns into a cocoon and then it’s a worm and then it turns
into a butterfly like poof.”
In this sample, “you” is not used as the audience and “first” is used so it is just a Sequence
exposition type.
• “What you need to growing plants. You need soil, sunlight and air and you need to water the
dirt first, and the first step, you got put seeds in the ground because if you don’t plants won’t,
um appear.”
In this sample, “you” is used throughout, but it also has as “first” so we would count it as How
To and Sequence.
Comparison
• Comparison compares two or more topics, events, characters or items.
• “Some animals eat plants and other eat meat. These are two groups of animals. Plant
herbivores and meat eaters. Some um…both…herbivores and meat eaters live in the jungle.
Elephants and tigers adapted on the ground, onto the ground in the jungle, but bird and
monkeys adapted in the high trees.”
Cause/Effect
• Cause/Effect tells how one event (the cause) leads to another event (the effect).
• We need to recycle and put trash in the trash bin. If we don’t recycle, bags and plastic can end
up in the ocean. Ocean animals think the trash is food, and they can get hurt if they try to eat
it. Also, if we don’t recycle and throw away our trash the earth will get very messy. That is why
need to recycle and put everything where it belongs.
Problem/Solution
• Problem/Solution presents an issue and proposes a possible solution.
• “A lot of people threw their trash on the ground, and that is why the forest is full of trash. To
keep the forest clean, people should not litter. They should put their trash in the trash cans and
they should recycle their plastic and metal. That is how we can keep the Earth clean.”
• Example 1:
“So hens they they are very loud animals and and cows are very very loud animal. Sometimes
people can go on the farm, and sometimes they like to um to see animals but they have to
make sure they don’t .. Um … don’t hit the animals or do something dangerous to the animals
because they might die … and if you hit animals, they might not have a very long life. Just like
hens, they might not have a very long life because they’re big, and fluffy, and can’t hide.”
– Classification: This has elements of Description and Cause/Effect.
• Example 2:
“Every time when you plant a seed um it grows big, big, and bigger. Um like mushrooms
aren’t even though you plant a seed and it’s still little … And um, trees, um they’re kind easy
to plant but its that you just need to water them every day. And um leaves are um like. Leaves
are sometimes come with um tress but kind like different seeds, like different leaves you have
to pant and um like you have if like grass, I think you have to plant because um, some grass
could could be rake because you buy them at the store and some flowers could be take too.
…And, um, I see in this picture it looks like they digged the found and they put a seed and
then they and they then they put the sand back where it belong and then the the mushroom
grow big.”
– Classification: Classification: This is clearly a How To exposition type because of how they
use “you” as the audience, the sentences “leaves are sometimes come with um trees” and
“they put a see and then they put the sand back where it belong and then the mushroom grow
big” are descriptive, How To would be the primary exposition type and Description would be
the secondary exposition type.

SENTENCE COMPLEXITY SCORE:
Comma in a list (other uses of commas are not scored)
Correct
• His favorite colors are red, blue, and green.
Incorrect:
• His favorite colors are red blue and green.
Count the Number of Words Written:
• A word is a letter or a string of letters that are separated from other words by spacing
and/or by interpretable spelling.
• A word can be counted as a word even if you do not know what the word is, but is
clearly set apart by spacing.
• If the sample does not have at least one interpretable sentence, do not score it for
punctuation.
• If it is not scored, in the excel cell for punctuation, put -1234.
Calculate the Number of Errors (based on punctuation needed):
1. Search through the sample for errors, beginning with “period at the end of sentence.”
2. For each error, fill in the circle or put an X on the number (1-3).
3. If you get to 3 before searching the entire sample, you can stop.
• If the type of punctuation was not needed in the sample (e.g., no question was asked),
fill in the 0 circle or put an X on it.
• If a punctuation was used, but it was not needed, it does not count as an error.
• Repeat steps for each type of error and then sum the errors.
Subtract # of Errors from # of Words Written = Punctuation Score

Count the Number of Words Written:
• A word is a letter or a string of letters that are separated from other words by spacing
and/or by interpretable spelling.
• A word can be counted as a word even if you do not know what the word is, but is
clearly set apart by spacing.
• If the sample does not have at least one interpretable sentence, do not score it for
capitalization.
• If it is not scored, in the excel cell for capitalization, put -1234.
• Always score punctuation first because capitalization errors are related to
punctuation.
Calculate the Number of Errors:
1. Search through the sample for errors, beginning with “lowercase for regular words.”
2. For each error, fill in the circle or put an X on the number (1-3).
3. If you get to 3 before searching the entire sample, you can stop.
• Repeat steps for each type of error and then sum the errors.
• Capitalization errors are independent of spelling errors!
• However, if you can’t figure out what the word is supposed to be, assume it is a regular
word.
Subtract # of Errors from # of Words Written = Capitalization Score

SPELLING
SCORE 0 = Unconventional Symbol SCORE 1 = Conventional Symbol
• � ◊ ⁕ • 9, bh, rR, B3x
SCORE 2 = Phonetic Representation
• Can only score this if you know what word they are trying to write.
• If can’t interpret the word, score as Conventional Symbol.
SCORE 3 = Invented Spelling
• Must have a vowel.
• Can only score this if you know what word they are trying to write.
• If no vowel, score as Phonetic Representation.
• If can’t interpret the word, score as Conventional Symbol.
SCORE 4 = Conventional Spelling
• Word is spelled correctly.
• Homonyms of the intended word would receive 3 points.
*The use of a symbol instead of a word such as & or # is not scored for spelling. Treat it as
missing and do not count it toward the word count for Writing Conventions.
SPELLING WORD RATING
Count the Number of Words Written
• A word is a letter or a string of letters that are separated from other words by spacing
and/or by interpretable spelling.
• A word can be counted as a word even if you do not know what the word is, but is
clearly set apart by spacing.
• If the sample does not have at least one interpretable sentence, score the entire
sample as either a 0 (if only unconventional symbols are used) or 1 (if sample has at
least one conventional symbol).
Rate Each Word
• Use the interpreted sample and the original sample to determine each word’s spelling
score (0-4).
• If using a word document or a printed sample, place the number (0-4) under each
word that corresponds to its rating.
• Add up all the scores and put that number in the top box “Sum of word ratings”.
• Divide the Sum of Word Ratings by # of Words Written = Average Word Rating
INTERPRETATION OF SCORES
• The scales for punctuation and capitalization are not restricted to 0-4, like spelling is.
• Therefore, each index should be interpreted individually without creating a Writing
Conventions total score.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: DDM
DYNAMIC DECODING
MEASURES
The simple view of reading and constituent strands of that model reveal the extent to which the
measurement of word recognition entails the assessment of multiple skills. The Dynamic Decoding
Measures (DDM) subtest assesses those key skills. The DDM measures 1) phonemic awareness,
including phoneme segmentation, phoneme blending, first sounds, continuous phoneme blending,
phoneme addition, phoneme deletion, and phoneme substitution, 2) orthographic mapping, which
provides the measurement of temporarily and irregularly spelled words, letter sounds, and letter
names, and 3) decoding, which provides information on a student’s ability to recode nonsense words
with multiple syllable types and patterns.
Administration and scoring of the DDM subtests can be done in real-time, either by hand, or via a
digital device using the Insight system. DDM Decoding forms are not grade-specific, yet guidelines
for when to administer each subtest and target are provided in this manual. The same DDM Decoding
subtests and targets are used for benchmark screening and for progress monitoring.

Phoneme Substitution – 2 2 4 4 4
Once a student can successfully blend and segment words

into phonemes orally, he or she likely has sufficient phonemic
awareness to decode, and spell written words.
The DDM Phonemic Awareness (PA) subtest has four targets:
• The first target on the subtest is Phoneme Segmentation, followed by Phoneme Blending, then
First Sounds, and then Continuous Phoneme Blending.
The DDM Phoneme Manipulation (PM) subtest has three targets:
• Phoneme Deletion, Phoneme Addition, and Phoneme Substitution.
There are dynamic assessments features embedded in the phonemic awareness subtests. First,
these subtests use a ‘test the limits’ procedure to identify a student’s current instructional level, to
examine how close a student is to demonstrating a more advanced level of phonemic awareness,
and to measure the extent to which that student is progressing in his or her phonemic awareness.
Second, there are instructional procedures used to help the student understand most of the phonemic
awareness tasks, and the examiner can identify whether a student has particular difficulty learning the
task that they will be asked to perform.
In the Phonemic Awareness and Phoneme Manipulation subtest, students are usually administered
the more advanced target first. If it is clear that the student cannot perform at that level, which can
be recognized quickly, then a less demanding skill is assessed until it is clear what a student can and
cannot do. If at any point along the continuum of testing a student meets benchmark expectations on
any target, subsequent targets are not administered. The same phonemic awareness measures are
repeatedly used for progress monitoring. There are no alternate forms because of the improbability of
a student being able to memorize the words used across the targets, and because the specific sounds
in each word are not taught in any testing-related teaching procedures.

Phonemic awareness interacts with and facilitates the development of
vocabulary and word consciousness
Phonological awareness and memory are involved in these activities of word learning:
• Attending to unfamiliar words and comparing them with known words
• Repeating and pronouncing words correctly
• Encoding words accurately so that they can be retrieved and used
• Differentiating words that sound similar (homophones) so their meanings can be
contrasted and accurately applied
Phoneme segmentation is one of two key skills that facilitates orthographic
mapping

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: DDM
Assessment Benchmark Expectations for:
Schedule* BOY Kindergarten to EOY First Grade
*Phoneme Segmentation is usually administered prior to the administration of the
Phoneme Manipulation subtest for all grades.
Time Varies according to student performance. Typically, less than 1 minute. This is an
untimed test.
Prompts • Always prompt the first item, then prompt as necessary with the remaining items.
“Tell me all the sounds in________”
• Corrective prompt (as needed): “Say all the sounds in the word, not the letter
names.” Mark as incorrect then go to the next word.
Scoring Overview Paper/Pencil:
1 point for each correct phoneme segmented in each word.
Circle the correct segmented phoneme and put a checkmark in the correct number of
phonemes.
Insight:
1 point for each correct phoneme segmented in each word.
Click on any incorrectly segmented phonemes.
Wait Rule If student does not respond within 3 seconds, mark the word as incorrect and go to
the next word. Prompt, “Tell me all the sounds in________”
Discontinue Rule If student produces incorrect response in last practice trial, STOP and go to Phoneme
Blending.

Before:
What is
Administered • Kindergarten: This is typically the first assessment administered to kindergarten
Before and After? students.
• First grade+ students are typically administered the NLM Reading and/or the NLM
Listening subtests first.
After:
• If the student is not at benchmark, then administer the Phoneme Blending target.
• BOY and MOY kindergarten: If student is at benchmark, discontinue Phonemic
Awareness subtest. Administer Orthographic Mapping subtest.
• *EOY kindergarten+: Administer the Phoneme Manipulation subtest.
• The Rapid Automatized Naming and Dynamic Assessment of Decoding subtests
from the PEARL and DYMOND can also help identify students who have dyslexia.
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at
sales@languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and
data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include
scripts for examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the
same every time.
• This is not a timed test.
• Prompt as necessary: “Tell me all the sounds in________”
• Corrective prompt (as needed): “Say all the sounds in the word, not the letter
names.” Mark as incorrect then go to the next word.
• Use the benchmark table provided at the bottom of the protocol form to determine
whether the student met benchmark expectations. Benchmark expectations are also
available in this manual.
• Record Response Patterns and take additional notes as needed.
• Schwa sound (the ‘uh’ sound) are not counted as errors.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors
(articulation errors), or influence of a language other than English.

single speech sounds. Students who can take apart words into sounds (segmentation),
demonstrate a foundational skill needed to use the alphabetic principle (Liberman,
Shankweiler, & Liberman, 1989; Troia, 2004).
Instruction in phonemic awareness helps beginning readers and spellers
Instruction in speech-sound awareness can prevent and mitigate spelling difficulties
(Adams, Foorman, Lundberg, & Beeler, 1998; Gillon, 2004; NICHD, 2000; Rath, 2001).
Explicit instruction in speech sounds also accelerates learning of the alphabetic code.
Phonemic awareness interacts with and facilitates the development of vocabulary and
word consciousness
Phonological awareness and memory are involved in these activities of word learning:
• Attending to unfamiliar words and comparing them with known words
• Repeating and pronouncing words correctly
• Encoding words accurately so that they can be retrieved and used
• Differentiating words that sound similar (homophones) so their meanings can be
contrasted and accurately applied
Phoneme blending is one of two key skills that facilitates orthographic mapping

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: DDM
Discontinue If student produces incorrect response in last practice trial, STOP and go to Continuous
Rule Phoneme Blending.
What is Before:
Administered • Phoneme Blending is typically administered prior to this target.
Before and
After:
After?
• If the student is not at benchmark, then administer the Continuous Phoneme Blending
target.
• If student is at benchmark, discontinue Phonemic Awareness subtest. Administer
Orthographic Mapping subtest.
• The Rapid Automatized Naming and Dynamic Assessment of Decoding subtests from the
PEARL and DYMOND can also help identify students who have dyslexia.
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts
for examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every
time.
• This is not a timed test.
• Prompt as necessary: “What is the first sound you hear in the word__________?”
• Corrective prompt (as needed): “Remember to say the first sound in the word, not the
letter name.” Mark as incorrect go to the next word.
• Use the benchmark table provided at the bottom of the protocol form to determine
whether the student met benchmark expectations. Benchmark expectations are also
available in this manual.
• Record Response Patterns and take additional notes as needed.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: DDM
What is Before:
Administered • First Sounds is typically administered prior to this target.
Before and
After:
After?
• Administer Orthographic Mapping subtest.
• The Rapid Automatized Naming and Dynamic Assessment of Decoding subtests from the
PEARL and DYMOND can also help identify students who have dyslexia.
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts for
examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every time.
• This is not a timed test.
• Prompt as necessary: “I’m going to say the word the slow way. You say it the fast way.”
• There are no corrective prompts.
• Use the benchmark table provided at the bottom of the protocol form to determine
whether the student met benchmark expectations. Benchmark expectations are also
available in this manual.
• Record Response Patterns and take additional notes as needed.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.
Specific Guidelines for Scoring the Continuous Phoneme Blending Target
The student said the word ‘ran’ in a typical,
blended manner.
The student said ‘moooose’.
The student said ‘sssssnooooo’

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: DDM
Wait Rule No wait rule.
Discontinue • If student produces incorrect response in final practice trial, STOP. Do not administer the
Rule Phoneme Deletion target or any other Phoneme Manipulation targets.
• If the student can successfully complete the final practice item, administer all Phoneme
Deletion items.
What is Before:
Administered • Phoneme Segmentation from the Phonemic Awareness (PA) subtest is typically
Before and administered prior to this target.
After?
After:
• Administer the Phoneme Addition target.
• The Rapid Automatized Naming and Dynamic Assessment of Decoding subtests from the
PEARL and DYMOND can also help identify students who have dyslexia.
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts for
examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every time.
• This is not a timed test.
• No prompts are allowed.
• Benchmark expectations are available in this manual.
• Record Response Patterns and take additional notes as needed.
• Schwa sound (the ‘uh’ sound) are not counted as errors.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: DDM
Discontinue • If student produces incorrect response in final practice trial, STOP. Do not administer the
Rule Phoneme Addition target or any other Phoneme Manipulation targets.
• If the student can successfully complete the final practice item, administer all Phoneme
Deletion items.
What is Before:
Administered • Phoneme Deletion is typically administered prior to this target.
Before and
After:
After?
• Administer the Phoneme Substitution target.
• The Rapid Automatized Naming and Dynamic Assessment of Decoding subtests from the
PEARL and DYMOND can also help identify students who have dyslexia.
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts for
examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every time.
• This is not a timed test.
• No prompts are allowed.
• Benchmark expectations are available in this manual.
• Record Response Patterns and take additional notes as needed.
• Schwa sound (the ‘uh’ sound) are not counted as errors.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.

of temporarily and permanently irregularly spelled words,
letter sounds, or letter names. The Orthographic Mapping
targets are timed in order to help measure automaticity.
Identifying irregular words and knowing letter sounds is important to decoding. However, it is not
necessary to know letter names to be an effective reader. Nevertheless, educators teach letter
names to young children, and are therefore often interested in documenting progress in that area.
Furthermore, conceptually, the process across all three targets is nearly identical, wherein an arbitrary
symbol or group of symbols is assigned one or more sounds from memory.
In the DDM Orthographic Mapping subtest, students are typically administered Irregular Words and
Letter Sounds. Because irregular word identification and letter sound identification are both important
to the decoding process, both targets are usually administered to younger students, even when
a student has met benchmark or demonstrates mastery on the Irregular Words or Letter Sounds
measures. Of course, if a student has reached mastery on any of the targets previously, those targets
do not need to be reassessed unless regression of skills is suspected. There is considerable flexibility
in the order of administration of the targets. If the examiner suspects that a very young student will
become quickly frustrated having to read irregular words, and will “shut down” because of the target
difficulty, then easier or earlier developing targets can be administered first, and the assessment can
get progressively harder instead of progressively easier. Young kindergarten students are administered
the Letter Names, and Letter Sounds targets, in that order, and Irregular Words is not administered.
There are no alternate forms because of the improbability of a student being able to memorize the
order of the words and letters used across the targets, and because the specific words, letter sounds,
and letter names are not taught in any testing-related teaching procedures.

• This is a timed test. The student has 2 minutes to read as many words as they can.
• Use the benchmark table provided at the bottom of the protocol form to determine
whether the student met benchmark expectations. Benchmark expectations are also
available in this manual.
• Record Response Patterns and take additional notes as needed.
• The word ‘a’ can be pronounced with a long or short vowel sound.
• Do not let the student skip a row.
• If student begins to read from top to bottom, or points randomly, say, “Go this way” and
move your finger from left to right along the row. This reminder can only be given one
time.
• If a student stops and it appears that they are not certain if they should continue, say
“keep going”. Say as often as necessary.
• If student loses their place, point to where they left off to help them find their place in the
row. Do this as often as necessary.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.

• Even if a student meets the benchmark criteria
on Irregular Words, Letter Sounds should be
administered in most cases. This is because both
irregular words and letter sounds are important

sound knowledge is a constrained skill, it may
not be necessary to administer the Letter Sounds
target if the student has previously demonstrated
mastery in letter sounds.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: DDM
Wait Rule If student pauses for 3 seconds, say the sound, mark it incorrect, and point to the next
letter. Do not score the letter ‘M’ used in the demo.
Discontinue • Discontinue after 2 minutes or when student reaches end of list.
Rule
What is Before:
Administered • Irregular Words is typically administered prior the Letter Sounds. However, the order of
Before and administration can be changed.
After?
After:
• If student is at benchmark on Letter Sounds, then discontinue the Orthographic Mapping
subtest.
o BOY kindergarten: Administer NLM Listening subtest.
o MOY kindergarten+: Administer Decoding Inventory subtest.
• If student is not at benchmark on Letter Sounds, then administer Letter Names target.
• The Rapid Automatized Naming and Dynamic Assessment of Decoding subtests from the
PEARL and DYMOND can also help identify students who have dyslexia.
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts
for examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every
time.
• This is a timed test. The student has 2 minutes to name as many sounds as they can.
• Use the benchmark table provided at the bottom of the protocol form to determine
whether the student met benchmark expectations. Benchmark expectations are also
available in this manual.
• Record Response Patterns and take additional notes as needed.
• Any appropriate letter sounds are correct (e.g., long/short vowels, guh / juh for ‘g’).
• Do not let the student skip a row.
• If student begins to read from top to bottom, or points randomly, say, “Go this way” and
move your finger from left to right along the row. This reminder can only be given one
time.
• If a student stops and it appears that they are not certain if they should continue, say
“keep going”. Say as often as necessary.
• If student loses their place, point to where they left off to help them find their place in the
row. Do this as often as necessary.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.

What is Before:
Administered • Letter Sounds is typically administered prior the Letter Names. However, the order of
Before and administration can be changed.
After?
After:
• BOY kindergarten: Administer NLM Listening subtest.
• MOY kindergarten+: Administer Decoding Inventory subtest.
• The Rapid Automatized Naming and Dynamic Assessment of Decoding subtests from the
PEARL and DYMOND can also help identify students who have dyslexia.
Reminders • Turn on your audio recorder. Email audio files to Language Dynamics Group at sales@
languagedynamicsgroup.com if LDG is contracted to help with scoring and data entry.
• Standardized administration is essential. Booklets and online instructions include scripts
for examiners to follow that help to ensure each subtest is administered the same every
time.
• This is a timed test. The student has 2 minutes to name as many letters as they can.
• Benchmark expectations are available in this manual.
• Record Response Patterns and take additional notes as needed.
• Any appropriate letter names are correct.
• Do not let the student skip a row.
• If student begins to read from top to bottom, or points randomly, say, “Go this way” and
move your finger from left to right along the row. This reminder can only be given one
time.
• If a student stops and it appears that they are not certain if they should continue, say
“keep going”. Say as often as necessary.
• If student loses their place, point to where they left off to help them find their place in the
row. Do this as often as necessary.
• Do not mark differences in pronunciation due to dialect, speech sound errors (articulation
errors), or influence of a language other than English.

and spelling. It also helps students break longer words into
more manageable parts.
The Decoding Inventory subtests of the CUBED provides an examiner information on how well a
student can (a) decode the syllable types, which are referred to as “targets”, (b) decode affixes, also
referred to as “targets”, and (c) read whole words with those syllable types and affixes.
The DDM Decoding Inventory subtest has nine targets:
• Close Syllables, Vowel-Consonant-E, Basic Affixes, Advanced Affixes, Vowel Teams,
Vowel-R-Controlled, Complex Vowels, Advanced Word Forms, and Multisyllabic Words in
Context
Decoding Inventory (DI) ALL TARGETS
Decoding
Construct
Measured This subtest primarily relates to the word recognition strand in Scarborough’s reading
model and falls under the decoding subskill.
Construct • Written English can be categorized under several syllable-spelling conventions
Significance • An understanding of these conventions can help students remember how to spell words
and how to pronounce the vowels in new words.
• Students need to learn how to chunk longer words into manageable parts. Some students
may see a longer word and resort to guessing the word or skipping it.
• Students need to be familiar with syllable-spelling conventions. This can help them read
longer words accurately and fluently and can help with spelling.

ADMINISTRATION & SCORING: DDM
Construct • Reading syllable patterns is a more advanced decoding skill, reliant on student
Connections mastery of phonemic awareness and phoneme-grapheme correspondences.
• Closed Syllables are the most common spelling convention in English. This syllable
pattern accounts for approximately 50 percent of the syllables in written language.
• Vowel-Consonant-E (VCE), also known as magic-e or silent-e contain long vowels
spelled with a single letter, followed by a single consonant, and a silent e.
• An Open Syllable will end with a long vowel sound. An open syllable is spelled with one
vowel letter. This pattern is called an open syllable because there is no consonant after
the vowel.
• Vowel Teams can be two, three, or four letters. These letter combinations represent
short, long, or diphthong vowel sounds.
• Vowel-R and R-Controlled syllables (sometimes called “Bossy R”) affect the sound a
vowel is supposed to represent.
• Stable Final Syllable, c-le combinations are found only at the ends of words.
• Complex Syllables are syllables that contain consonant clusters (i.e., a sequence of two
or three consonant phonemes) spelled with a consonant blend before and/or after the
vowel.
• These syllable patterns are represented in the Decoding Inventory subtest of the CUBED-3.
MOY Kindergarten to EOY Eighth Grade.
Assessment
Schedule
Varies according to student performance.
Time
Prompts • “Please read these words. They are not real words.”
• If it appears the student is reading the words using phonology from a language other than
English, say “Read these nonsense words in English.”
• Corrective Prompt (up to two times per word): If student refuses to read, say, “I can’t
help. Just try your best.”
• Corrective Prompt (one time per target): “Remember, these are not real words.”
• Examiners should not penalize a child if a different dialect is being used other than what is
reflected in the tables below.

CUBED-3 INTERPRETATION
An examiner must interpret the data collected from a test so that decisions and actions can be made.
If a test does not provide guidelines for clear interpretation, then that test lacks validity. The CUBED-3
provides two different ways to interpret test results. The first approach is through criterion-referencing,
and the second approach is through norm-referencing.
Criterion-Referenced Interpretation
When CUBED-3 results are interpreted through a criterion-referenced lens, examiners use raw scores
to represent a student’s performance (e.g., 25 correct words per minute), and make a determination
about whether the student’s scores meet expectations according to a pre-defined criterion (e.g., 45
correct words per minute). The simplest way to characterize student performance on a criterion-
referenced test is to use a binary classification system that sorts students according to whether they
do or do not meet expectations. However, many criterion-referenced assessments, including the
CUBED-3, provide more specified characterizations of student performance. With the CUBED-3,
students can be categorized as “at benchmark” if they meet criteria, at “moderate risk” if their
performance is moderately lower than expected, and at “high risk” if their performance is very low.
Risk status refers to the extent to which a student is at risk for experiencing difficulty in the specific
domain being tested.
In conjunction with these three classifications (benchmark, moderate risk, high risk), one additional
classifying tier, “advanced”, is available for students significantly above benchmark on some of the
CUBED-3 measures. This finer-tuned classification allows for greater differentiation of students who
would otherwise be grouped together in the benchmark category.
The CUBED-3 has different criteria for adequate performance (or benchmarks) depending on the
measure. The CUBED-3 criteria are based on three major sources of information: a) national and state
education standards, such as the Common Core State Standards, b) research that has identified the
necessary criteria for academic success, including regression analysis, and c) current norms, which
were mostly used as a baseline reference upon which the (often higher) criteria were established.
The following tables display the cut points for key CUBED-3 assessments for the beginning of the
school year (BOY), middles of the school year (MOY), and end of the school year (EOY) across all
grades.

student is at BENCHMARK Irregular words are words that do not follow the standard
across ALL OM targets. phonics rules. This includes high frequency words with irregular
spellings (e.g., the, said, are, come) as well as words for which
the phonics rules will be taught later. For example, the word
like is irregular for a kindergartener who has not yet learned
the silent –e rule, but it is not irregular for a first grader who
has learned the silent –e rule. Because a sounding out strategy
cannot be used to read all of the parts of irregular words,
students must memorize the oral word or part of that oral word
that corresponds to the written word or part of that written word
and be able to produce it in an automatized manner. It can
be helpful to use flash cards or other drill type instruction to
teach irregular words, but it is recommended that, to the extent
possible, students practice irregular words while they read
books instead of in isolation. Irregular words should be taught
and practiced as they appear in the books students read rather
than learning a large set of sight words before students have
seen them in books. It is also important not to introduce irregular
words before students are consistently using a sounding out
strategy for decodable words. Struggling readers may default to
guessing with all words before they have attempted a sounding
out strategy. Therefore, interventionists should be careful not to
encourage early readers to approach decodable words in the
same manner they approach irregular words. It is conceptually
this: the irregular portions of a word are explicitly taught while
the decodable parts of a word are read in the same manner as
any other decodable word.
Letter Students who need to work on letter sounds should practice
Sounds saying the sounds that correspond to each letter. This can be
taught and practiced using flashcards, repeated one-minute
timings, and any other repeated practice strategy. When
introducing letter sounds, it is important that visually and
auditorily similar letters are separated. For example, the sounds
/f/ and /v/, /t/ and /d/, /b/ and /d/, /b/ and /p/ are auditorily similar
and the letters b and d, b and p, q and p, n and m are visually
similar. Their introduction should be separated by several
sessions. The more useful letters of s, a, t, m, and i should be
introduced first because students will be able to decode many
words with them. The first letter sounds should be continuous
sounds (e.g., m, s, f, l, r, n). Students should be encouraged to
hold the sound for 2 seconds. Begin teaching letter sounds using
lower case letters instead of upper-case letters. Introduce one
sound for each letter at first, usually the most common sound
(e.g., /k/ for c, not /sss/). Letter sounds can be targeted alongside
letter names, first sounds, and oral phoneme segmenting.

consonant-vowel-consent words (e.g., man, sun). It may be
helpful to teach students to say words the slow way without
stopping between sounds before teaching them to isolate
each sound in the word. For example, first teach, “Say ‘man’
the slow way.” “mmmaaannn.” Then teach, “Say all the
sounds in the word man.” “/mm/ /aa/ /nn/.” Interventionists
may choose to use visuals such as holding up a finger or
moving a small chip each time a different sound in the word is
produced. Phoneme segmentation can be targeted alongside
oral phoneme blending, letter sounds, and letter names.

can be added to the ending –an to make tan, pan, man, can,
fan, and ran. To the extent possible, this activity should be
integrated with letters so that the visuals can help students
understand that each letter makes its own sound. As students
are able to identify the first sound of simpler, single-syllable
words, it is appropriate to have them practice identifying first
sounds of more complex words. First sounds can be targeted
alongside letter sounds and letter names.

the way in which it is spoken are called r- or l-controlled vowels. Before
teaching the silent –e rule, students need to know the long and short sounds
associated with each vowel. Once teaching of the silent –e rule, it is helpful
for students to decode CVC words and then decode the same word with the
–e added to the end. For example, students should be able to change rat to
rate and sit to site. It is also appropriate to point to the –e at the end of the
word before students begin to decode it. This draws attention to the –e and
its influence on the vowel. As a letter combination is introduced, students will
need many opportunities to read lists of words with these patterns in them.
The Decoding Inventory subtest of the CUBED can provide an inventory of the
syllable types a student can decode, use the information from this subtest to
guide instruction.

it in an automatized manner. It can be helpful to use flash cards
or other drill type instruction to teach irregular words, but it is
recommended that, to the extent possible, students practice
irregular words while they read books instead of in isolation.
Irregular words should be taught and practiced as they appear
in the books students read rather than learning a large set of
sight words before students have seen them in books. It is
also important not to introduce irregular words before students
are consistently using a sounding out strategy for decodable
words. Struggling readers may default to guessing with all words
before they have attempted a sounding out strategy. Therefore,
interventionists should be careful not to encourage early readers
to approach decodable words in the same manner they approach
irregular words. It is conceptually this: the irregular portions of a
word are explicitly taught while the decodable parts of a word are
read in the same manner as any other decodable word.
Letter Students who need to work on letter sounds should practice
Sounds saying the sounds that correspond to each letter. This can be
taught and practiced using flashcards, repeated one-minute
timings, and any other repeated practice strategy. When
introducing letter sounds, it is important that visually and auditorily
similar letters are separated. For example, the sounds /f/ and
/v/, /t/ and /d/, /b/ and /d/, /b/ and /p/ are auditorily similar and the
letters b and d, b and p, q and p, n and m are visually similar.
Their introduction should be separated by several sessions. The
more useful letters of s, a, t, m, and i should be introduced first
because students will be able to decode many words with them.
The first letter sounds should be continuous sounds (e.g., m, s,
f, l, r, n). Students should be encouraged to hold the sound for 2
seconds. Begin teaching letter sounds using lower case letters
instead of upper-case letters. Introduce one sound for each letter
at first, usually the most common sound (e.g., /k/ for c, not /
sss/). Letter sounds can be targeted alongside letter names, first
sounds, and oral phoneme segmenting.

consecutive vowels contribute to the unique sound. Vowels followed by
an r or an l that influence the way in which it is spoken are called r- or
l-controlled vowels. Before teaching the silent –e rule, students need to
know the long and short sounds associated with each vowel. Once teaching
of the silent –e rule, it is helpful for students to decode CVC words and then
decode the same word with the –e added to the end. For example, students
should be able to change rat to rate and sit to site. It is also appropriate to
point to the –e at the end of the word before students begin to decode it.
This draws attention to the –e and its influence on the vowel. As a letter
combination is introduced, students will need many opportunities to read
lists of words with these patterns in them. The Decoding Inventory subtest
of the CUBED can provide an inventory of the syllable types a student can
decode, use the information from this subtest to guide instruction.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
Development of CUBED-3 Test Items
In this section, we provide a detailed account of the development process of the CUBED-3. This
information offers evidence of content-description validity. This evidence of validity provides a
rationale for the behaviors the test assesses and establishes how those behaviors are important to the
construct being measured.
Construct Identification, Measured Behaviors, and Test Organization
As discussed in the beginning of this manual, we identified two superordinate constructs that we
intended to measure with the CUBED-3: word recognition and language. To measure the construct of
word recognition, we identified four core behaviors that we wanted to measure based on a thorough
review of the research. We further analyzed those behaviors for underlying skills and processes that
would help identify a student’s zone of proximal development. Those four word-recognition related
behaviors were phonemic awareness (with phoneme segmentation, phoneme blending, first sound
identification, and phoneme blending and three phoneme manipulation tasks: substitution, addition,
and deletion), orthographic mapping (with irregular word reading, letter-sound identification, and
letter-name identification), decoding (with multiple syllable types and affixes), and reading fluency
(with decoding fluency as an index of the correct words read per minute, accuracy, and prosody). To
measure the construct of academic language, we identified core behaviors that we wanted to measure
based on the curriculum standards and a thorough review of the research. Those behaviors were
narrative and expository retelling (assessing the comprehension and production of narrative discourse,
vocabulary complexity, and sentence complexity), comprehension of factual questions (primarily
focused on discourse structure), inferential word learning (assessing the ability to infer the meaning of
unfamiliar words through context), inferential reasoning (text-to-text and text-to-self/world inferencing),
and oral and written narrative production (assessing expressive oral and written language).
Development of the DDM Phonemic Awareness and Phoneme Manipulation Subtests
For the development of the DDM Phonemic Awareness measure, 544 words comprised of two,
three, four, and five sounds were selected from the Dolch high frequency word list. These words
were categorized according to the number of phonemes in each word and according to whether they
contained continuous sounds. Words were then randomly selected from each category and randomly
assigned to the Phoneme Segmentation, Phoneme Blending, First Sounds, and Phoneme Continuous
Blending targets. This resulted in 35 total words. The Phoneme Segmentation target initially had 15
words, the First Sounds target had 10 words, and the Phoneme Continuous Blending target had five
words. Field trials with kindergarten, first, and second grade students indicated that words with five
sounds were too complex for the phoneme segmentation task. Thus, all of the words with five sounds
were removed, resulting in 10 total words for the Phoneme Segmentation target. Ten words were
initially selected for the First Sounds target, and two of those words were replaced in order to reduce
initial sounds redundancy. The five words included in the Phoneme Continuous Blending target were
randomly selected from the list of Dolch high frequency words that contained continuous sounds.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
Field trials with young students resulted in minor changes to the words, primarily to ease the process
for the examiner.
Development of the DDM Orthographic Mapping Subtest
For the development of the Irregular Words target in the Orthographic Mapping subtest, 135 irregular
words were selected from the Dolch sight word list and then ordered by frequency. Information from
Carnine et al., (2004), Kameenui and Simmons (1990), the Common Core State Standards, and several
commercially available reading curricula were also reviewed, and the sequence in which irregular
words were introduced in those curricula was documented. Because none of the curricula followed the
same sequence for introducing irregular words, we ordered the words as best as possible according
to any identifiable overlap in words and patterns across programs and research. Several school
administrators and teachers also reviewed the irregular words in the DDM Word Identification measure.
These educators made recommendations for the inclusion or extraction of irregular words and word
order. This process resulted in a slight reordering of the words, and the inclusion of five additional
words. Subsequent field trials with kindergarten, first, second, and third grade students resulted in
additional changes in specific words and in the order of words. Previous versions of the CUBED
required students to read as many words as they could in two minutes. This provided considerable
data on the words most students could read at each time period in each grade. We analyzed those
data and concluded that a student’s ability to read temporarily and permanently irregularly spelled
words could be validly measured in 1 minute as opposed to 2 minutes. Thus, we reduced the time limit
from 2 minutes to 1 minute in the CUBED-3 to increase efficiency.
For the development of the Letter Sounds target in the Orthographic Mapping subtest, a review
of several commercially available reading curricula indicated that an average of 6 upper and lower
case sounds were introduced within the first month or two of kindergarten, and that by mid-year,
approximately 16 letter sounds had been taught. By the end of the kindergarten school year, after
approximately 38 weeks of instruction, all 52 upper-case and lower-case letter sounds had been
taught. End of kindergarten Common Core expectations indicate that students should “demonstrate
basic knowledge of one-to-one letter-sound correspondences by producing the primary sound or
many of the most frequent sounds for each consonant [and] associate the long and short sounds with
the common spellings (graphemes) for the five major vowels.” Thus, children should at least know the
common sound for each of the consonants and major vowels of English at the end of kindergarten.
The standards also indicate that at the end of first grade, students should “know the spelling-sound
correspondences for common consonant digraphs.” We documented the sequence in which different
letter sounds were typically introduced across different reading curricula. Because no two curricula
followed the same sequence of letter sounds, we consulted with several school administrators and
teachers across the U.S., as well as reviewed research on letter sound acquisition. These additional
investigations resulted in the current sequence of upper- and lower-case letter sounds found in the
CUBED-3. In later pilot research, teachers and administrators recommended the inclusion of 10 upper-
and lower-case digraphs, expanding the total number of letter sounds to 62. As was the case with the
Irregular Words target, previous versions of the CUBED-3 required students to produce as many letter
sounds as they could in two minutes. After several years of research, we concluded that a student’s
ability to identify letter sounds could be validly measured in 1 minute instead of 2 minutes.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
For the development of the Letter Names target in the Orthographic Mapping subtest, all upper- and
lower-case letters were identified and then sequenced according to several published preschool
and kindergarten curricula. Because no two curricula followed the same sequence of letter names,
we consulted with several administrators and teachers, as well as reviewed research on letter name
acquisition. These additional investigations resulted in the current sequence of upper- and lower-
case letter names found in the CUBED-3. In the updated CUBED-3 assessment, letter sounds are not
affiliated with benchmark expectations.
Development of the DDM Decoding Inventory Subtest
For the DDM Decoding Inventory, we reviewed the scope and sequence of syllable type and affix
instruction across multiple published curriculums, including Orton Gillingham-based curriculums, 95%
Group, and CKLA. We created multiple nonsense words that included increasingly more advanced
patterns within each syllable type and affix category. Initial trials included a larger pool of items in each
target area from which 6 words that included patterns typically introduced in the beginning, middle,
and end of year were identified. Those 6 words were placed at the beginning of the word list for each
target area and benchmark expectations were established.

Development of the DDM Dynamic Assessment of Decoding
For the DDM Dynamic Assessment of Decoding subtest, we randomly generated a list of closed
vowel CVC and consonant cluster closed vowel CCVC nonsense words using the majority of English
consonants and vowels. Any words that did not meet common English orthographic and phonotactic
properties were eliminated. A total of 136 nonsense words were selected and then organized by
CVC and CCVC patters and vowel groupings. These nonsense words were then randomly placed
into groups of four. The nonsense words used in the Silent ‘e’ target were constructed by randomly
selecting nonsense words not included in the CVC and CCVC targets, and appending an ‘e’ at the
end of each word. If the resulting word was indeed nonsensical (to the best of our discernment), and
was orthographically and phonotactically probable, then it was included in the potential list of silent ‘e’
words. After constructing the silent ‘e’ word list, words were randomly selected for final item inclusion
and several field trials were conducted.

Development of the DDM Rapid Automatized Naming Subtest
We conducted a thorough review of the research and modified a rapid automatized naming task
investigated by Catts et al. (2001) and Petersen & Gillam (2015).
Development of the NLM Listening and NLM Reading Subtests
Each NLM story was constructed following precise narrative structure guidelines. Narrative structure,
or story grammar, is comprised of specific structural elements. The story grammar in the NLM stories
follows a pattern outlined by Stein and Glenn, (1979), which tends to match academic expectations.
Story grammar elements are combined to form episodes in a narrative. The key story grammar
elements of a basic episode include a problem, an attempt to solve the problem, and a consequence.
NLM Preschool stories have very basic story grammar, with a main character, setting information with
an activity and a location, a problem, the character’s feeling about the problem, an attempt to solve
the problem, a consequence resulting from the attempt to solve the problem, and an ending. The
NLM kindergarten through eighth grade stories have the inclusion of a plan that is stated right before

================================================================================
TECHNICAL INFORMATION
the character’s attempt to solve the problem, and end feelings describing how the character feels at
the end of the story. Additional complexity is embedded in second through eighth grade stories in the
form of multiple episodes, including a complication in which the first attempt to solve the problem
does not work. All kindergarten through eighth grade stories include both informational and persuasive
expository language.
A narrative, like any other type of discourse, is also built from language complexity. Language
complexity used in narration can be evaluated according to the extent that more complex and
precise structures and vocabulary are present. A story can be produced using very basic vocabulary
and grammar, but more successful, academically related narratives involve complex sentence
structures with a clear time sequence and causal connections between events. Language complexity
also increases with age. Average sentence length increases, and syntax becomes more complex.
Language features such as openings, dialogue, adjectives, and temporal and adversative conjunctions
(then, but) are earlier emerging. Adverbs, temporal subordinate clauses (e.g., after he got scared,
he ran away), relative and nominal (including complemental) subordinate clauses, and multiple
subordina¬tion increase in frequency and complexity as children’s language grows. Several linguistic
features that mark high level oral language capabilities such as additional subordinate clauses,
adverbs, adjectives, and low frequency vocabulary words are increasingly more prevalent as the NLM
grade levels increase.
The above guidelines were helpful in crafting parallel stories that are socially appropriate and cross-
culturally relevant. Criteria for story grammar complexity and language complexity were initially drafted
after a thorough review of the research on narrative developmental expectations and preliminary
normative data from approximately 1000 preschool, kindergarten, first, second, and third grade
students. Several empirical studies brought to light the extent to which typically developing students
and students with language impairment could improve narrative structure and language complexity
after narrative-based language instruction and intervention. Concurrently, a thorough review of
the Common Core State Standards and other state standards further shaped passage criteria,
increasing language complexity and influencing the stories to reflect both narrative and expository
language properties. Lexile indices primarily derived from the Common Core State Standards were
calculated for each story, and editing took place to structure each passage until a Lexile range was
consistent within grade level. Each final story underwent careful editing by linguists, speech-language
pathologists, and the authors. For the NLM Listening measure, feedback was elicited in field trials with
teachers and speech-language pathologists in several states. Awkward wording and any additional
editing suggestions were noted and the passages were revised, processed through the strict a-priori
development criteria, and molded to yield the appropriate Lexile index. For the NLM Reading, all
25 within grade-level stories were administered to several first, second, third, fourth, and fifth grade
students. The number of correct words read in one minute was documented, as was accuracy,
specific word errors, prosody, and the total time required to read the entire passage. Variability within
and across students was noted, and consistently outlying stories were identified and revised. Revised
stories were then administered to naïve students and again assessed for outlying status.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
Each NLM Listening and NLM Reading story, within grade level, has nearly the exact same number
of words (varying only from 2 to 10 words). Each story within grade level also consistently has the
omission or inclusion of an exact, pre-specified number of story grammar elements, character name
references, episodes, single pre-noun adjectives, double pre-noun adjectives, pre-verb adverbs, post-
verb adverbs, adverbs of likelihood, non-overlapping tier-2 vocabulary words to the greatest extent
possible, the temporal conjunction then, the adversative conjunction but, the continuative conjunction
so then, left-branching temporal subordinate clauses with the subordinating conjunction when, left-
branching temporal subordinate clauses with the subordinating conjunction after, right-branching
causal subordinate clauses with the subordinating conjunction because, right-branching causal
subordinate clauses with the subordinating conjunction so that, left-branching adverbial subordinate
clauses with the subordinating conjunction although, adjectival (relative) subordinate clauses using
that or who, two or more subordinate clauses in the same utterance not associated with dialogue,
dialogue, and appositives with and without relative clauses. Each story is written with ‘universal’
personal themes in mind that can transcend culture (e.g., getting hurt), with specific accounts that
are plausible to have occurred in the lives of preschool and school-age children in the U.S. and other
countries.
Each NLM Listening and NLM Reading story has also been equated using the Lexile index. The first
several utterances of the first grade, second grade, and third grade NLM Reading stories have a lower
Lexile index to accommodate beginning readers, but the entire story still matches the Lexile index of
the NLM Listening passages. See table below.
Development of the NLM Comprehension Questions Section of the NLM
For development of the Comprehension Questions section of the NLM Listening and the NLM Reading
measures, items that assessed factual story grammar information were included. The initial questions
underwent minor revisions after preliminary field trials to better elicit specific story grammar elements.
Development of the NLM Vocabulary Questions Section of the NLM
For development of the Vocabulary Questions section of the NLM Listening and the NLM Reading
measures, three tier-2 (less common, academic) vocabulary words previously embedded in the
narratives of each passage according to the a-priori development criteria were identified and then
examined for distant and adjacent contextual support within the passage. In the event that two editors
(usually the authors of this test) deemed the contextual support insufficient to facilitate inferential word
learning, or the contextual support was too adjacent (proximal to the vocabulary target) or too distant
(three or more sentences from the vocabulary target) the story was modified to provide additional
contextual support for that word and/or the contextual support was moved within the story. Any
modification of a story to provide greater contextual support of a tier-2 vocabulary word sparked a
new round of careful editing and examination to ensure that any modified story met parallel forms and
Lexile criteria. The extent to which the NLM Listening and NLM Reading grade-level stories are parallel
is reported in the reliability section of this manual.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
Development of the NLM Inferential Reasoning Questions Section of the NLM
The Inferential Reasoning questions include text-to-text and text-to-self/world questions. Each
NLM passage was carefully engineered to include references that would either support text-to-text
inferencing or topics that would support text-to-self or text-to-world inferencing.
Development of the NLM Vocabulary Use Section of the NLM
For development of the Vocabulary Use section of the preschool NLM Listening, three tier-2
vocabulary words that were embedded in each passage per story composition guidelines described
above were identified in each passage. These “tier-2 words” were initially selected from a large
database of low frequency words and were then embedded in each grade-level passage based on
the extent to which the words would be unfamiliar to the students in that grade. The objective was
to include words that would be more commonly used in academic oral language reflective of written
language as opposed to casual conversation.
Development of the NLM and ELM Flowcharts
As a companion to the NLM Listening and Reading subtests, the NLM Flowchart includes similar
items related to story structure (i.e., character, setting, problem, emotion, plan, attempt, consequence,
ending) and sentence complexity (i.e., causal and temporal ties. Initial items for the ELM Flowchart
were generated through an exhaustive review of literature related to expository academic language.
Indispensable to this review were corpus analyses of the language structures encountered in
academic textbooks and in the productive academic language (oral and written) of children and
adolescents (Biber et al., 1999). Ultimately, most of the items from the Sentence Complexity subscale
of the NLM Flowchart were retained, but the Passage Structure subscale contained novel items
relevant to the expository discourse research literature.
The new NLM and ELM Flowcharts for the CUBED-3 were iteratively developed and refined over the
course of two years. In multiple cycles, at least two raters used the draft versions of the Flowcharts to
score sets of 50-100 language samples. Based on interrater reliability and item total correlation results,
items were either eliminated or revised. Additionally, this iterative refinement informed the development
of the NLM Flowchart and ELM Flowchart scoring guides that were used to score the language
samples used for the psychometric analyses in this manual. The final versions of the Flowcharts
contain the subscales and items presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

BENCHMARK CRITERION SELECTION
Where clear curriculum standards are not outlined, we used the 40th percentile from normative data
as the benchmark expectation. Further research support for the 40th percentile. As noted by Mellard &
Johnson (2008): “because screening does not directly result in a diagnosis, it is better for a screening
instrument to err on the side of false positives (identify students as at risk that might not be at risk).
Therefore, a wider net with which to capture potentially at-risk students can be cast with screening
measures,” (p. 25). As noted above, using the 40th percentile as a benchmark does cast a wider net.
Related, Nelson writes that, “the current state of affairs is one in which to achieve high sensitivity an
allowance must be made for substantial false positives rates” (p .6). Therefore, a higher number of
false positives when using the 40th percentile as the cut score is both advantageous and expected.
For cut points for risk, we designated scores between the 16th and 39th percentile as moderate
risk and the 15th percentile and lower is high risk. Data collected from 2015 to 2023 with over 5000
students across the U.S. were used to identify cut points for risk. It should be noted that we use the
term “risk” (i.e., moderate risk, high risk) as indicators of how far below the benchmark expectation a
student’s performance falls.
DDM Phonemic Awareness Criterion Selection
The two DDM Phonemic Awareness subtests assess Phonemic Awareness and Phoneme
Manipulation. The Phonemic Awareness targets are Phoneme Segmentation, Phoneme Blending,
First Sounds, and Continuous Phoneme Blending. The Phoneme Manipulation targets are Deletion,
Addition, and Substitution.
Phonemic awareness tends to follow a developmental progression. Although there are several ways
to assess phonemic awareness, the CUBED-3 includes approaches that are scalable, efficient, and
valid markers of progress. Students tend to be able to identify first sounds in a word (e.g., what sound
does milk start with?) and blend sounds orally before they can segment phonemes (Adams et al.,
1998; Gillon, 2004; Goswami, 2000; Paulson, 2004; Rath, 2001). Approximately 85% of five-year-old
students can identify the initial sounds in words, and orally blend phonemes presented slowly into a
cohesive word. Approximately 30% of 5-year-old students can blend single phonemes into words,
yet most children who are between the ages of 6;0 (years;months) and 6;5 can blend two and three
phonemes together. Approximately 85% of six-year-old students can segment words that have two
or three phonemes – a task that approximately 90% of 5-year-old students cannot do. Most children
who are six and a half can segment words with more than three phonemes, including phonemes
represented with grapheme blends (e.g., sh). Also at about 6;6, most children can substitute
phonemes in simple syllables to create new words. At age 7, children can delete phonemes at the
initial and final position and at 8 years of age, children can delete phonemes initial from blends, and at
9 years of age, children can delete phonemes from medial and final positions (Moats & Tolman, 2009;
Paulson, 2004). These normative data are quite revealing and serve as a starting point for establishing
benchmark expectations. Yet they are only just a starting point. The CUBED-3 has been administered
to thousands of children across the world, and the wealth of data obtained from our research partners
further guide us in the identification of the appropriate benchmark and cut points for risk for each of
the Phonemic Awareness targets.

BENCHMARK CRITERION SELECTION
Continuous Phoneme Blending
Starting at the simplest task, Continuous Phoneme Blending, data indicate that kindergarteners at the
beginning of the school year had scores with a mode of 10 (out of 10 possible points), and that the
mean performance was 7.01 with a standard deviation of 3.33. The 50th percentile score was 8, and
the 16th percentile was a score of 3. In the middle and end of year, the mode and the mean was 10
with a standard deviation of .80. Students at the 16th percentile scored a 9 in the middle and end of
the year, and those at the 7th percentile scored 7.6. These data are confounded by the fact that the
majority of children administered the Continuous Phoneme Blending target were first identified as at
risk on the First Sounds target. In other words, the modes, means, and standard deviations obtained
for the Continuous Phoneme Blending target are from a sub sample of students (n = 165) who had
weaker phonemic awareness. National norms indicate that approximately 85% of five-year-old
students can orally blend phonemes presented slowly into a cohesive word.
Taking all of these data into consideration, we determined that the beginning kindergarten benchmark
expectation for the Continuous Phoneme Blending target should be 7 (40th percentile), with moderate
risk ranging between 3 to 6 (around the 16th percentile to the 39th percentile) and high risk assigned
to students whose scores ranged from 0-2 (performance below the 16th percentile). Kindergarten
students who score a 10 at the beginning of the year are performing at the 75th percentile, and are
designated as advanced. Kindergarten benchmark expectations for the middle of year for this target
were set at 10 (the ceiling), with moderate risk assigned to scores of 9, and high risk assigned to
scores of 0-8. End of year benchmark expectations for kindergarten students was also set at 10, with
high risk assigned to scores ranging from 0-9. These end of year kindergarten expectations and cut
points for risk extend through first grade (and all grades above).
First Sounds
Identifying first sounds in words is generally a more difficult task than the continuous phoneme
blending task in the CUBED-3, yet data indicate that kindergarteners at the beginning of the school
year had scores with a mode of 20 (out of 20 possible points), and that the mean performance was
15.49 with a standard deviation of 4.97. The 50th percentile score was 17, the 40th percentile was 16,
the 25th percentile was a score of 14, and the 16th percentile was a score of 10, the 10th percentile
was 7. The 75th percentile was a score of 19. Middle of year data for first sounds is not representative
of a normal sample because first sounds was only administered to students who were at moderate
or high risk on phoneme segmentation. Nevertheless, the data indicate that even for students who
struggle with phoneme segmentation, first sounds in the middle of the school year is a fairly simple
task. Across two studies, the means were 17.28, (mode = 20) and 17.83 (SD= 3.22, Mode = 20). The
50th percentile was 19, the 40th percentile was 18, and the 16th percentile was 15.8 and the 10th
percentile was 12.5 and 12.7 (respectively). The 75th percentile was a score of 20.
Phoneme Blending
Phoneme blending is a new target for the revised CUBED-3. Initial benchmarks for phoneme blending
were established using research data from Paulson (2004), Moats and Tolman (2009), and preliminary
trials with 222 kindergarten and first grade students. Preliminary data for MOY for 195 kindergarten
students indicated that the mean was 3.88 (SD 1.16) with a mode of 5. The 16th percentile was 3.00.

The 10th percentile was 2.00. The 5th percentile was 1.00. The 40th and 50th percentile was 4.00. The
75th percentile was 5.00. Phoneme blending MOY for first grade students indicated a mean of 3.93
and a standard deviation of 1.17. The mode was 4.00. The 16th and 25th percentile was 3.00. The
10th percentile was 2.00. The 40th and 50th percentiles were 4.00. The 75th percentile was 5.00.
Phoneme Segmentation
We used Phoneme Segmentation (the first target in Phonemic Awareness) as a general outcome
measure for younger grades because we did not find floor effects. Our phoneme segmentation
findings from a sample of 1,721 students are in line with developmental expectations and current
curriculum expectations. Scores below the 16th percentile were categorized as high risk. Scores
ranging from the 16th percentile to the 39th percentile were categorized as moderate risk. Scores
ranging from the 40th to the 74th percentile were categorized as at benchmark. Scores at or above the
75th percentile were categorized as advanced. When mastery of phoneme segmentation was noted
and expected (e.g., end of first grade and with second grade students+), we set the benchmark at
90% accuracy for end of first grade and ~95% accuracy for second grade and higher.
Phoneme Substitution
The Phoneme Substitution subtest is a new addition to the CUBED-3 revision. Initial benchmarks
for Phoneme Substitution were established using research data from Paulson (2004), Moats and
Tolman (2009), and preliminary trials with 224 first and second grade students. First grade MOY data
revealed a mean of 2.70 (.93), with a mode of 2 (maximum of 5). The 10th to the 40th percentiles were
a score of 2. The 50th and the 75th percentiles were a score of 3. The 90th percentile was a score
of 4.00. Second grade BOY data revealed a mean of 3.21 (1.05), with a mode of 3. The 5th to the
25th percentiles was a score of 2.00. The 40th percentile was a score of 3.00. The 75th percentile
was a score of 4. Second grade MOY data revealed a mean of 3.88 (1.26) and a mode of 5. The 16th
percentile was 2.72. The 40th percentile was 3.80. The 50th percentile was 4.00. The 75th percentile
was 5.00.
Phoneme Addition
The Phoneme Addition subtest is a new addition to the CUBED-3 revision. Initial benchmarks for
Phoneme Addition were established using research data from Paulson (2004), Moats and Tolman
(2009), and preliminary trials with 126 second grade students. BOY Second Grade data indicated a
mean of 3.93 (1.00) with a mode of 4. The 16th percentile was 3.00. The 40th percentile was 4.00. The
75th percentile was 5.00.
Phoneme Deletion
The Phoneme Deletion subtest is a new addition to the CUBED-3 revision. Initial benchmarks for
Phoneme Deletion were established using research data from Paulson (2004), Moats and Tolman
(2009), and preliminary trials with 99 second grade students. BOY second grade data indicated a
mean of 4.10 (1.03) with a mode of 5 (max 5). The 10th to the 25th percentile was a score of 3.00. The
40th percentile was a score of 4.00. The 75th percentile was a score of 5.00.

BENCHMARK CRITERION SELECTION
DDM Orthographic Mapping Criterion Selection
The DDM Orthographic Mapping subtest provides a means to measure three different aspects of
sound-symbol recall: The recognition of temporarily and permanently irregularly spelled words,
letter sounds, and letter names. These skills do not necessarily follow a developmental sequence,
although word recognition is certainly the more complex task due to the sheer number of words
students need to decode. The extent to which a student knows a certain letter name, a certain letter
sound, or a certain word has much to do with what the student is taught and has been exposed
to. Parents and preschool and kindergarten teachers tend to focus first on letter names with young
children, they will also focus occasionally on letter sounds and on certain words, such as the child’s
name. This sequence isn’t based on developmental expectations, per se, but more on cultural
and pedagogical trends. Because of this, the targets in the Orthographic Mapping subtest are not
necessarily hierarchical, and examiners may wish to administer all three targets to a student regardless
of performance on any target. The Orthographic Mapping subtest targets are all timed. Students are
given 1 minute to complete the Irregular Words and Letter Sounds targets. Student are given 2 minutes
to complete the optional Letter Names target. This time restriction is to allow for the measurement of
automaticity. We are not only interested in whether a student can recall words, letter sounds, and letter
names, but that they can do so quickly so that reading fluency can ensue. Thus, when administering
the Orthographic Mapping subtest to students, it is very important that the examiner follows the
standardized administration procedures and does not allow a student to struggle with a word, letter
sound, or letter name for more than 3 seconds. A more comprehensive inventory can be obtained by
continuing to administer the test after 1 minute, yet the data from this lengthier administration is for
information purposes only. The benchmark expectations and cut points for risk are always based on
student performance in 1 minute.
Although all three Orthographic Mapping targets reflect a similar construct, we provide benchmark
scores for only two of the three targets (Irregular Words and Letter Sounds) to drive specific instruction
necessary for learning to decode. With our initial sample of 1,512 students, we found floor effects with
the Irregular Words target with preschool and early kindergarten students, yet with the Letter Sounds
and Letter Names targets we found adequate distribution of scores. The case was reversed with
students at the end of kindergarten and in first and second grade, where ceiling effects were noted
with Letter Sounds and Letter Names targets, but Irregular Words had good dispersion of scores.
These findings align with current curriculum expectations.
Thus, we used data from our sample of students to guide the development of risk criteria. Scores
below the 16th percentile were categorized as high risk. Scores ranging from the 16th percentile to the
39th percentile were categorized as moderate risk. Scores ranging from the 40th to the 74th percentile
were categorized as at benchmark. Scores at or above the 75th percentile were categorized as
advanced. When mastery of any of the Orthographic Mapping targets was noted and expected (e.g.,
with third grade students), we set the benchmark for irregular words at 90% and the benchmark for
letter sounds was set at 95% accuracy.

BENCHMARK CRITERION SELECTION
Letter Names
Although we do not provide benchmark expectations or cut points for risk for the Letter Names target,
the following table can be useful for examiners to reference. Note that the majority of students who
were administered Letter Names were at moderate or high risk on Letter Sounds. This means that the
data in the tables below represents the means and standard deviations for students who are not a
representative sample of the population.
Kindergarten BOY Letter Names National Norms. Normative data from several sources on letter
naming at the beginning of kindergarten indicate that the 50th percentile ranges from 12 to 16 correct
letter names. National data for the 10th percentile at the beginning of the year ranges from 1 to 2.
For the middle of the kindergarten year, the 50th percentile national norms range from 35 to 39, and
the national norms for the 10th percentile range from 13 to 14. The national norms 50th percentile
at the end of the kindergarten year range from 45 to 52 and the end of year letter names at the 10th
percentile range from 28 to 29. Piasta, Petscher, and Justice (2021) noted that at the beginning of
kindergarten, 10 letter names indicated that students were at low risk. According to national norms,
about 50% of letters can be identified on average by kindergarten students at the beginning of the
school year.
Kindergarten Letter Names CUBED Data. The scores at the 40th percentile, 16th percentile, and
10th percentile for the normative sample are displayed in the DDM Orthographic Mapping table on
page 128. The CUBED-3 Letter Names target was only administered to students at risk on Letter
Sounds. Therefore, if the CUBED-3 Letter Names is administered to all kindergarten students at the
beginning of the school year, we would expect the CUBED-3 40th percentile to be higher than what is
reported in the table.
Letter Sounds
We conducted several studies to identify the benchmark and cut points for letter sounds for
kindergarten and first grade students. National normative data indicate that at the beginning of
kindergarten, letter sounds mean scores are around 2, and the 10th percentile is 0 (20th percentile
is 1). At the middle of the year, kindergarteners increase their ability to identify letter sounds ranging
from 18 to 25, with the 10th percentile ranging from 6 to 14. At the end of kindergarten, letter sounds
means range from 34 to 36, with the 10th percentile ranging from 17 to 18. These normative data are
somewhat difficult to interpret because letter sound knowledge is so dependent on the instruction a
student receives (for example, data from one instructional program has BOY norms for kindergarten at
1-13 and EOY kindergarten norms ranging from 6-19, starkly different from other assessment norms.
Our research with a 2-minute time limit with approximately 2000 students indicate that middle of
kindergarten CUBED-3 Letter Sounds (with a maximum score of 61) resulted in means and standard
deviations of 43.42 (14.77). The 50th percentile was 50. The 40th percentile was 46. The 16th
percentile was 26, and the 10th percentile was 19. The 75th percentile was 54. Referencing these data
and the national normative data, we set the benchmark for MOY kindergarten at 15, moderate risk
at 6-14, and high risk at 5 or lower. For end of kindergarten, data with a 2-minute time limit with 153
students indicated that the mean was 56.08 (9.46) and the 50th percentile was 59. The 16th percentile

was 53 and the 10th percentile was 46.40. Because many of the students were able to complete the
entire list of 61 letters in less than 2 minutes, benchmark data for the 1-minute task is higher than a
simple calculation of 50% of the 2-minute data. Consequently, end of kindergarten benchmark was set
at 30, with moderate risk at 19-29, and high risk at 18 or lower.
The beginning of first grade CUBED-3 Letter Sounds mean with a 2-minute time limit was 52.60
(12.64). The 50th percentile was 57, the 40th percentile was 55, the 16th percentile was 49. The 75th
percentile was 59. Benchmark for the beginning of first grade with a 1-minute time limit was set at 30,
with moderate risk at 19-29, and high risk at 18 or lower.
The middle of first grade CUBED-3 Letter Sounds mean with a 2-minute time limit was 52.39
(12.93). 50th percentile was 57. 40th percentile 57. 16th percentile was 40.32. 75th percentile is 60.
Benchmark for MOY first grade with a 1-minute time limit was set at 35, with moderate risk at 27-34
and high risk at 26 or lower.
End of first grade data for letter sounds with a 2-minute time limit were only collected with 22 students
who were having considerable difficulty with decoding. Even so, their mean performance was 53.23
(16.02) with the 50th percentile at 59, the 16th percentile at 50, and the 10th percentile at 21. End of
first grade benchmark with a 1-minute time limit was set at 43, with moderate risk at 31-42 and high
risk at 30 or lower.
Second grade BOY benchmark with a 1-minute time limit was set at 43, moderate risk 31-42, and high
risk 30 or lower. MOY and EOY second grade benchmark with a 1-minute time limit was set at 45, with
moderate risk at 40-44, and high risk at 39 or lower.
Irregular Words
We conducted several studies with a 2-minute time limit to identify the benchmark and cut points for
Irregular Words for kindergarten, first, and second grade students. For end of kindergarten, the mean
was 28.97 (15.04), with the 50th percentile at 28, the 40th percentile was 25, the 16th percentile 12,
and the 10th percentile 9. For middle of kindergarten with the 2-minute time limit, the 75th percentile
was 26, the 40th percentile was 13, the 16th percentile was 11, and the 10th percentile was 10.
Benchmark expectations for MOY kindergarten with the 1-minute time limit was set at 7, moderate risk
was 4-6, and high risk was set at 0-3.
EOY kindergarten with the 1-minute time limit was set at 12, with moderate risk set at 8-11 and high
risk set at 7 or lower.
For the beginning of first grade with the 2-minute time limit, the mean for Irregular Words was 30.72
(17.82). 50th percentile was 32. 40th percentile was 26. 16th percentile was 8. 10th percentile was 3.
75th percentile was 49. The benchmark expectations for the 1-minute time limit was set at 12, with
moderate risk set at 8-11 and high risk set at 7 or lower.
For middle of first grade with the 2-minute time limit, the mean for Irregular Words was 41.62 (14.57).
The 50th percentile was 49. The 40th percentile was 45. The 16th percentile was 24.44. The 10th

and 34 and lower reflecting high risk.
DDM Decoding Inventory Criterion Selection
The Decoding Inventory is a new subtest in the revised CUBED-3. We conducted a systematic
review of the research literature and carefully examined several reading curricula that had an explicit,
systematic, and sequential approach to phonics instruction to identify the number of syllable types
and affixes kindergarten through third grade students were expected to decode in the beginning,
middle, and end of the school year. We identified eight phonics categories (Beck & Beck, 2013):
Individual consonants, short vowels, consonant blends, consonant digraphs, long vowels in CVCE
words, long vowels in CVVC words, r-controlled vowels, other vowel patterns, and multisyllabic words.
We cross-referenced this with the six syllable types outlined by Moats and Tolman (2009): Closed
syllables, open syllables, vowel-consonant-silent-e, vowel teams, r-controlled, and consonant-le.
We created nonsense words that included each of these patterns following guidelines outlined by
Colenbarnder, Nickels, and Kohneni (2011), with some limitations due to the need for the development
of an efficient screener. These nonsense words were then ordered into a generalized scope and
sequence within and across grades (e.g., Sedita, 2020), categorized under what we refer to as
“targets”: Closed Syllables, Vowel-Consonant-E, Basic Affixes, Advanced Affixes, Vowel Teams, Vowel-
R-Controlled, Complex Vowels, Advanced Word Forms, and Multisyllabic Words in Context (Table 8).
For each target, examiners are able document how well a student can recode each specific target
embedded in the nonsense words and examiners can document how well the student can blend
each word correctly, which provides information on whether a student can recode initial and final
blends, digraphs, double consonants, open syllables, final stable syllables, silent consonants, and
miscellaneous patterns that are embedded in the words (Table 9).

BENCHMARK CRITERION SELECTION
We established benchmark expectations for each target for BOY, MOY, and EOY for kindergarten
through third grade. We then ran preliminary trials with representative samples of students from
kindergarten to third grade (n ~ 200) with the full set of items. To improve efficiency, we selected two
representative targets from the beginning, middle, and end of the list to determine whether those six
targets would be representative of a student’s ability to decode all of the targets listed, serving as a
general screener. Those six screener words are in boxes in Table 8 above. For first grade BOY, the
correlation between the closed syllables screener score (total possible points = 6) and the total score
was .90. The R2 was .81. For second grade BOY, the correlation between the closed syllables screener
score and the total score was .88. The R2 was .77. For second grade, the correlation between the VCE
syllables screener score and the total score was .88. The R2 was .78. For second grade, the correlation
between the Basic Affixes syllables screener score and the total score was .83. The R2 was .69.
Because of these very strong correlations and R2 estimates, we used the six words for each syllable
type and basic and advanced affixes to generate a new set of benchmarks and cut points for risk for
the screener items. The entire list of all possible combinations for each syllable type is still available
for reference for examiners wishing to obtain a more comprehensive inventory of a student’s ability to
decode across all syllable types and affixes.
NLM Listening and NLM Reading Retell and Questions Criterion Selection
We used current curriculum standards to establish NLM Retell and NLM Questions benchmark
expectations for kindergarten through sixth grade (see tables on following pages). Seventh and eighth
grade benchmark expectations were based on performance at or above the 40th percentile. To identify
cut points for risk, we analyzed the data from over 5000 preschool through eighth grade students from
Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Utah, and Wyoming and used scores
below the 16th percentile for high risk, and scores between the 16th percentile and benchmark for
moderate risk.

NLM and ELM Flowcharts
We provide preliminary normative data that can be used to help determine whether a student is
performing as expected on the NLM and ELM Flowcharts. Participants were recruited from 60 before/
after school care and summer care programs operated by one of the largest school districts in the US,
which had a student population that closely represents the national student population. Any student
currently in or entering (if data were collected in summer) into K-3rd grade in the subsequent fall
semester was eligible to participate. Enrollment of sites and students was rolling and took place over
15 months. In total, data from 1,179 K-3rd grade students were collected. See Table x for a summary
of demographic characteristics.

NLM Reading Fluency Criterion Selection
The Reading Fluency section of the NLM is a particularly informative measure because it
contextualizes the decoding process and provides the most realistic index of a student’s ability to
convert written, arbitrary symbols into language. Three important scores are obtained from Reading
Fluency, a) the correct words read in one minute (Decoding Fluency), b) Accuracy, and c) Prosody.
Decoding Fluency and Accuracy scores provide meaningful information on a student’s automatic word
recognition and decoding ability, and Prosody scores provide information on the extent to which a
student is able to convert the written code to oral language (yet high scores on any of these measures
does not necessarily indicate that a student is understanding what they are decoding).
Two factors need to be considered when determining whether a student is at benchmark or needs
additional help with decoding fluency: a) the student cannot understand what he or she decodes
because the language-conversion process is not sufficiently fluent, and b) the student cannot read
with sufficient fluency to keep up with the core curriculum.
We referenced Hasbrouck and Tindal’s (2017) national data on oral reading fluency for grades 1 to 6
and Hasbrouck and Tindal’s (2006) national data for grades 7 and 8. We also referenced Rasinski et
al, (2002) to establish an upper ceiling for older grades and examined normative data from several
commonly used assessments and examined our preliminary data from the CUBED-3 to determine
benchmark expectations for the Decoding Fluency sections of the NLM Reading. The Decoding
Fluency assessment benchmark is set at the 40th percentile. Scores between the 11th and 39th
percentile represent moderate risk, and scores at or below the 10th percentile represent high risk.
Decoding fluency scores at or above the 75th percentile are characterized as advanced.
Composite Scores
CUBED-3 composite scores provide an estimate of a student’s overall reading ability because they
reflect the product of word recognition and oral language. The primary purpose of the CUBED-3
composite scores is to predict future reading performance. The CUBED-3 composite scores can also
be used to grossly characterize a student’s reading ability, yet because specific needs cannot be
identified using composite scores, they should not be used to place students into intervention groups.
For statistical purposes in earlier studies, we calculated composite CUBED-3 scores by converting
raw scores to z-scores, transforming those z-scores to scaled scores, and then combining those
scaled scores together. Scaled scores are standard scores with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation
of 3. Z-scores can be transformed into scaled scores by multiplying a z-score by 3 (the standard
deviation of the distribution of scaled scores) and adding 10 (the mean of the distribution of scaled
scores) to this product. For example, a z-score of –1 equals a scaled score of 7 [10 + 3(-1) = 7]. This
approach was used for the data displayed in Tables 10, 11, and 12 in the Criterion-Related Validity
section of this manual.
The composite scores that examiners calculate are derived from logistic regression analyses. In our
series of logistic regression models for each grade, we saved the multiple predictor variables from the
CUBED as a single probability index, and that probability index was used as the predictor in our ROC
analyses, which provided AUC and sensitivity and specificity estimates. This single probability score

is not easy to calculate nor is it particularly easy to interpret. We were able to identify the predictor
variables that were most predictive in each model, weight those variables accordingly, and sum all
of the appropriate predictors together. This resulted in a composite score that had similar predictive
power as the probability index. The formulas for calculating the composite scores are displayed below.

RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY
Special Psychometric Considerations for Criterion-Referenced Assessments
A criterion-referenced test is defined more by the way in which its results are interpreted than by
any necessary special content, administration, or scoring procedures. Criterion-referencing entails
examining the results of a test and determining if those results meet a predefined expectation or
standard – often referred to as a benchmark. With a norm-referenced test, a student’s results are
referenced to the performance of other students usually to determine how far from the mean that
student’s scores fall. Thus, results interpreted through norm-referencing are reported in a relative
manner, such as at the 2nd percentile (essentially meaning that relative to the normative group, a
student’s performance was better than 2% of the sample). With criterion-referencing, the interpretation
is absolute, not relative, and student performance is most often expressed as raw scores (e.g., 20),
percent correct (e.g., 67%), or in a descriptive manner (e.g., student told a story with beginning,
middle, and end information). With a criterion-referenced test, the question is whether a student meets
the expectations established. Meeting this expectation is irrelevant to whether all, some, or none of
the other students meet that expectation. If the criterion is very high, few students may meet it. In
contrast, if the criterion is low, many or all the students will meet it.
Although it is the interpretation of scores that defines a criterion-referenced or norm-referenced test,
criterion-referenced tests often do have unique characteristics that help them meet certain screening
and progress monitoring purposes.
Multiple characteristics of reliability and validity were investigated for the CUBED-3. We first examined
reliability, including alternate form reliability and standardized administration and scoring. We then
examined validity, including the extent to which the CUBED-3 measures socially meaningful behaviors.
Estimates of reliability and evidences of validity are extremely important to consider when deciding
whether a test is appropriate for an examiner’s needs. If a test isn’t reliable, then the examiner cannot
have confidence that the results of the test are an accurate estimate of a student’s abilities. Evidence
of validity provides the examiner with information on how well the test measures what it is supposed
to measure, and helps the examiner know how well the test will likely satisfy his or her purpose for
administering the test. An examiner should always evaluate the information about a test’s validity while
keeping in mind his or her purpose for administering the test, and, most importantly, the examiner’s
purpose for using the test should align with the test’s intended purpose. After examining multiple
evidences of reliability and validity, we analyzed the efficiency and ease of use of the CUBED-3 and
the extent to which is it sensitive to change over time.

================================================================================
RELIABILITY
Reliability refers to how consistently a test can measure something across different conditions and
situations. If a test lacks reliability, then the examiner will have limited confidence in the results of that
test. It is common to calculate reliability using several methods.
A Special Note on Reliability for Universal Screeners and Progress Monitoring
Tools
Universal screening and progress monitoring tests are not focused on comparing an individual
student’s score to the performance of a larger population. Instead, such criterion-referenced tests
have the purpose of comparing student scores to a criterion or to their own previous scores. These
tests are designed to compare a student’s performance to a benchmark or cut point that is typically
aligned with curriculum expectations and to monitor progress within each student. The benchmark
expectation does not have to have anything to do with how the greater population of students
is performing. The benchmark is instead a goal or expectation that presumably the majority of
students can and should meet after evidence-based instruction. Thus, with a progress monitoring
tool, educators are not interested in having student performance spread out across a normal
distribution, where the performance of some students is significantly below others. On the contrary,
universal screening and progress monitoring tools are designed to document student progress due
to instruction over time on parallel forms of the test. This implies that it is desirable that student
performance on a universal screening and progress monitoring assessment end up at the high end of
the score distribution, forming a negative skew close to the ceiling (e.g., 100%). Conversely, it can also
be expected that there will be a positively skewed distribution when the majority of students perform
poorly on a criterion-referenced test, such as at the beginning of the school year prior to instruction.
This aggregation of scores at the top or bottom of the distribution is not at all in alignment with the
normal curve and causes significant problems with correlation analysis. Correlation requires variance.
And when there is little variance in scores, the correlation will be low and not representative of the
reliability of the test.
Another problem with relying on traditional, correlation analyses for the reliability of universal screening
and progress monitoring assessments is that we are interested in raw values of scores, not just
whether scores are correlated. For example, four different students could receive scores of 9, 10,
12, and 14 correct out of a 25 point test, and then score 20, 21, 23, and 25 correct on a second
administration of that test. The test-retest (or parallel forms) correlation would be 1.0, or perfect.
But the students’ scores are not consistent at all. The perfect correlation coefficient would, under
classical test theory, indicate that the test is perfectly reliable, yet such an interpretation would be very
wrong. The opposite situation could occur where a weak correlation may indicate that a test is not
very reliable, when in fact scores from the test administered at time one and then again at time two
are very consistent. For example, four different students could receive scores of 7, 9, 10, and 11 on a
first test administration, and then receive scores of 6, 10, 11, and 9 on a second test administration.
The correlation between these scores would be very low, yet from a progress monitoring perspective,
the test scores are probably highly related – or reliable (Brown, 1990). Because of the distribution of
scores, and the way in which scores are interpreted in progress monitoring tests, alternative estimates
of reliability that do not rely on correlations are needed.

================================================================================
RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY
Thus, in addition to common approaches to examining reliability, such as the examination of inter-
rater reliability, fidelity of administration, and alternate forms reliability, we calculated estimates of
reliability using threshold-loss agreement and squared-error loss agreement (Brown, 1990; Brown
& Hudson, 2002).
Threshold-loss agreement.
The threshold-loss agreement estimate of reliability is used with benchmark assessments. This
analysis uses a procedure very similar to what is used to obtain evidence of validity for a norm-
referenced language test: sensitivity and specificity. Threshold-loss agreement is very similar to
sensitivity (master) and specificity (non-master) conceptually, yet it is used as a measure of reliability
as opposed to validity. With threshold-loss agreement, students are administered a progress
monitoring test at time one, and then are administered a parallel form of the test, or the same test
again, at time two. Students who were classified as meeting the benchmark expectation (masters)
at time one should also be found to meet the benchmark expectation at time two. The same pattern
should be found for students who did not meet the benchmark expectations. Classification should
be aligned between the two test administrations. The resultant data, which we acquired through
logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic analyses, provides evidence of reliability. Below
we report threshold-loss agreement analyses for the NLM Retell, NLM Questions, and the Reading
Fluency subtests for beginning of year data (BOY from a random sample of approximately 200
students from a pool of approximately 5000 students) in first grade, second grade, and third grade.
• NLM retell threshold-loss agreement. Because there is a practice effect with the NLM Reading
measure with younger students (e.g., < fourth grade), where time 1 performance is typically lower
than time 2 performance, examiners are directed to select the highest NLM Reading score if two are
administered. This practice effect does have an influence on the threshold-loss agreement reliability
estimate. Furthermore, the data for the NLM for time 1 and time 2 only reflect performance from
students who were not at benchmark on the first NLM benchmark. Even so, when benchmark 1
and benchmark 2 from NLM Reading BOY are dichotomized as 1 = at or above benchmark and 0
= at-risk, logistic regression indicates that time 1 is a significant predictor for time 2, with 29% of
the variance accounted for in first grade, 45% of the variance accounted for in second grade, and
31% of the variance accounted for in third grade. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses
reveal that with time 1 predicting time 2, the area under the curve (AUC) for first grade is .79 with
69% sensitivity and 89% specificity, for second grade the AUC is .86 with 75% sensitivity and 97%
specificity, and for third grade the AUC is .76 with 67% sensitivity and 85% specificity.
• NLM Question threshold-loss agreement. When NLM Questions data from BOY 1 and BOY 2 are
dichotomized, logistic regression indicates that time 1 is a significant predictor for time 2, with 40%
of the variance accounted for in first grade, 30% of the variance accounted for in second grade, and
for third grade, 43% of the variance was accounted for. ROC analysis indicated that the AUC for
first grade was .79 with 70% sensitivity and 89% specificity, for second grade the AUC was .77 with
67% sensitivity and 87% specificity, and for third grade the AUC was .90 with 83% sensitivity and
97% specificity.

• NLM Reading Fluency threshold-loss agreement. When NLM Decoding Fluency data (CWPM)
from BOY 1 and BOY 2 are dichotomized, logistic regression indicates that time 1 is a significant
predictor for time 2, with 76% of the variance accounted for in first grade, 81% of the variance
accounted for in second grade, and for third grade, 90% of the variance was accounted for. ROC
analysis indicated that the AUC for first grade was .96 with 94% sensitivity and 98% specificity, for
second grade the AUC was .96 with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and for third grade the
AUC was .97 with 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
Squared-error loss agreement.
Squared-error loss agreement provides information on how well a progress monitoring test
consistently classifies students along a continuum of scores, not just a binary met/not met
classification. Squared-error loss agreement provides information on the distance from which a
student is from a cut-point (benchmark). Statistical procedures such as the phi(lambda) dependability
index (Figure 4; Brennan, 1980, 1984) are used. Written in statistical notation, the formula for the
phi(lambda) dependability index may look daunting, yet conceptually it is simple and requires only a
few items of information: the number of test items, the benchmark expectation (cut point) expressed
as a proportion (e.g., .80 or 80% of test items correct), the mean performance on the test by a
group of students, also expressed as a proportion (e.g., .90 or 90%), and the standard deviation of
proportion scores. This procedure yields a coefficient that provides information on how well the test
consistently ranks a student along the continuum of possible test scores from time one to time two.

out of a total of 186 possible words (k). The mean proportion was .4564 and the standard deviation

Inter-Rater Reliability.
For inter-rater reliability, two independent examiners should assign similar scores to the same student
response. This type of reliability is very important especially for the NLM subtests of the CUBED-3
because there is a certain amount of subjectivity involved in scoring a student’s language in real-
time, despite clear scoring procedures. Inter-rater reliability at or above 80% is acceptable, and at
or above 90% is preferred. We focused considerable resources on collecting inter-rater reliability of
the CUBED-3 subtests. Inter-rater reliability of real-time scoring of the NLM subtests was analyzed
with over 60 independent examiners. Results of this analysis, reported in the reliability section of
the CUBED-3 Examiner’s Manual, indicated that the NLM can be scored with excellent reliability.
Furthermore, because two parallel forms of the NLM Listening and NLM Reading subtests (with
appropriate grade levels) are administered, and the highest score from those test administrations is
recorded, measurement error is minimized, and the examiner can have greater confidence that the
results of the test approximate a student’s “true” score.
• DDM inter-rater reliability. Approximately 100 graduate and undergraduate students, general and
special education teachers, and speech-language pathologists, ranging from no prior experience to
over 30 years experience administering standardized assessments, administered the DDM to 1,746
kindergarten through eighth grade students. These 26 examiners participated in approximately 2

hours of training prior to test administration. Seven undergraduate students in speech-language
pathology independently scored the DDM for inter-rater reliability. These 7 students received
approximately 1 hour of training on how to score the DDM. These students then listened to and
independently scored 10% of DDM administrations. Point-to-point inter-rater reliability, shown in
Table 10, was excellent for all DDM targets.
• NLM inter-rater reliability. For the NLM Listening and NLM Reading, inter-rater reliability was
calculated from 25% NLM stories retold by 898 school-age children and 163 preschool children.
Seventy-eight examiners, the majority of whom had minimal experience administering and scoring
language assessments independently, scored the NLM. Examiners underwent approximately 2
hours of training. Inter-rater reliability for scoring the NLM, shown in Table 10, was excellent for the
narrative retell and factual story questions, and acceptable for inferential vocabulary and inferential
reasoning questions.

RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY
• NLM Flowchart and ELM Flowchart inter-rater reliability. For the NLM and ELM Flowcharts, inter-
rater reliability was calculated by two independent raters from 25% of language samples collected
from 1,179 kindergarten through third grade students. Point-by-point percent agreement scores
and Cohen’s kappa coefficients (Cohen, 1960) were calculated to indicate the level of agreement
among scorers (Cooper et al., 1987). Cohen’s kappa (Cohen, 1960) was calculated to account for
the possibility of chance agreement between raters. Reliability data for the NLM Flowchart and ELM
Flowchart are shown in Table 11. Interrater agreement for individual NLM Flowchart items ranged
between 51% and 96% (mean = 85%). Interrater agreement on individual ELM Flowchart items
ranged between 40% and 99% (mean = 84%). The majority of Kappa coefficient values suggest
substantial agreement between raters.

Standard Error of Measurement.
A student’s raw score on the NLM is unlikely to be their true score. To account for this test error, the
standard error of measurement (SEM) and confidence intervals were calculated. SEM was calculated
by grade level for fall and winter by multiplying the standard deviation (15) by the square root of 1-r,
where r was the inter-rater reliability coefficient (i.e., .95). One SEM is equal to 68% confidence, 1.65
SEMs are equal to 90% confidence, and 1.96 SEMs are equal to 95% confidence. This range (band
or interval) around the student’s raw score provides additional confidence in the results of the test.
Results of these analyses can be found in the CUBED-3 Norm Referenced Technical Manual.
Fidelity of Administration
Fidelity of administration refers to the extent that examiners administer a test following outlined
procedures. The results of a test may not be reliable if the test is administered differently each time
it is given or if it is administered differently by multiple examiners. This type of reliability is typically
measured using a checklist or some other documented form of observation that measures how
closely the examiner adheres to the administration procedures outlined in the test manual. It is often
reported as the percent of administration steps completed correctly. The CUBED-3 test developers
observed 65 examiners who underwent 1 to 4 hours of training (M = 2.4 hours) and documented
fidelity of test administration using fidelity checklists. Fidelity of administration was excellent at 94%
(87%-100%). For the NLM and ELM Flowcharts, fidelity checks were conducted regularly to ensure
elicitation and transcription integrity. An independent RA listened to 26% (n = 1,060) of recordings
of language sample elicitations and used a checklist to document adherence to the protocol. Using
this procedure, elicitation fidelity was determined to be 99%. Additionally, 24% (n = 955) of the total
samples were transcribed by a second, independent RA. A third person then reviewed the first and
second transcriptions, calculated percent agreement between the two, and documented adherence
to transcription procedures for each transcriber. A mean transcription fidelity score for transcriber one
was calculated at 99%. Transcribed content was identical between transcribers an average of 93%
of the time. Any language samples with an agreement score below 80% underwent a reconciliation
process, wherein a third transcriber listened to recordings and used best judgement to decide on a
final transcription.
Alternate Forms Reliability
Alternate or parallel-forms reliability refers to the extent to which two forms of a test are similar to
each other. Because the CUBED-3 is designed for progress monitoring, there are multiple forms that
are parallel in content, length, and complexity. When alternate forms of a test are parallel, gains a
student makes over time can be attributed to factors unrelated to differences between the alternate
forms. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) can be calculated to provide information
on the strength and direction of the linear relationship between alternate forms. Correlation coefficients
need to be interpreted differently than simple calculations of percent agreement (e.g., 90%), which is
what we used for inter-rater reliability and fidelity of administration. Positive correlation coefficients
range from .01 (negligible) to 1.0 (perfect). Coefficients ranging from .20 to .29 are considered weak,
coefficients ranging from .30 to .39 are considered moderate, coefficients ranging from .40 to .69
are considered strong, and coefficients at or above .70 are considered very strong. Alternate forms
correlation coefficients for the CUBED-3 are described below and displayed in Table 12.

• NLM Alternate Forms Reliability. The alternate forms of the CUBED-3 NLM Listening and the NLM
Reading measures are designed to be parallel within and across subtests. Considerable evidence
of the parallel nature of the NLM passages can be found in the rubric used to write each story, the
Lexile scores assigned to each story, and the mean length of utterance (MLU) for each story. The
process whereby the NLM forms were equated is described in detail in the CUBED-3 Development
section of this manual. Correlation coefficients were calculated to provide additional evidence of the
parallel nature of the NLM Listening and NLM Reading forms.
For 212 preschool children, the correlation coefficient between all 25 passages of the NLM Listening
was .71. For personal story generations, the correlation coefficient was .61. Correlation coefficients
for 1077 kindergarten, first, second, and third grade students for beginning of year (BOY) NLM
Listening benchmark passages was .55. Correlation coefficients for 1062 kindergarten, first, second,
and third grade students for middle of year (MOY) benchmark passages was .59. Correlation
coefficients for 696 first, second, and third grade students for the BOY NLM Reading benchmark
passages was .67. Correlation coefficients for 611 first, second, and third grade students for the
MOY NLM Reading benchmark passages was also .67.
For school-age stories, the correlation between the NLM Listening and NLM Reading stories was
analyzed in the fall with a total of 110 participants (55 second grade students and 55 third-grade
students). The students attended a school where they received half-day instruction in English and
half day instruction in either Spanish or Navajo. The sample consisted of 48% (n=53) Hispanic, 28%
(n=31) Native American, 20% Caucasian (n=22), 3% (n=3) who reported two or more ethnicities,
and .01% (n=1) African American students. Of the 53 Hispanic students, 60% (n=32) were Spanish
language dominant. All other students were English language dominant. The correlation between the
NLM Listening and NLM Reading for all participants was .75. The correlation was .74 for Hispanic
students, .67 for Native American students, and .74 for Caucasian students. Correlations for all
second-grade students was .72 and for all third-grade students it was .73. The results described
above, and outlined in Table 8, indicate that alternate form reliability within and across the NLM
Listening and NLM Reading measures is excellent.

VALIDITY
Validity, according to the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (American Educational
Research Association, American Psychological Association, and National council on Measurement in
Education, 1999) is the “degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretation of test scores
entailed by proposed uses of tests.” (p. 9). As pointed out by Gall et al. (2007), and Messick (1995),
it is the interpretation of test scores that hold validity. That is, the results of a GOM instrument need
to be interpretable, meaningful, and actions based on test results need to be appropriate (Gall et al.,
2007; Messick, 1989, 1995). Test validity can be measured by accumulating evidence to support the
proposed application of test results. Evidence of validity has traditionally been organized according
to content-description validity, criterion-prediction validity, and construct-identification validity, which
correspond to overlapping (rather than alternative) empirical and logical approaches taken during
a test’s development and use. This section of the CUBED-3 technical manual provides detailed
information related to each of those evidences of validity.
A Note on Bias
There is a high degree of impartiality in the expectations set forth in curricula across the U.S. The
standards are for all students, including those who are culturally, linguistically, and economically
diverse. Thus, with a criterion-reference assessment, the concern is not whether the items are biased
against a certain group (e.g., ethnicity), but instead whether any group might have particular difficulty
learning to perform as expected. Across the DDM and NLM measures, we have found that explicit,
systematic decoding and language instruction, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or socio-economic
status, has resulted in students achieving the benchmark expectations of the CUBED-3. Although we
expect some groups to initially perform lower than other groups on some of the CUBED-3 measures,
we consider this to be a temporary state, and expect that with instruction, the vast majority of
students will learn to decode, and produce and understand complex language.

RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY
Criterion-Related Validity
Concurrent Validity
Evidence of validity can be derived by examining the relationship between the CUBED-3 and the
results of other assessments administered at approximately the same time. This examination is
designed to demonstrate the extent that the CUBED-3 results are comparable to results from
previously validated instruments that measure similar constructs (convergent evidence of validity;
Bachman, 1990; McNamara, 2000) or that the CUBED-3 results differ considerably from results of a
test that measures different constructs (divergent evidence of validity). This convergent and divergent
evidence of validity, often represented as concurrent criterion-related validity (concurrent validity for
short), is highly dependent on the existence of valid, external tests. In this section, the results of six
studies with 1,146 preschool through third grade students that examined evidence of convergent and
divergent concurrent validity for the CUBED-3 are reported. Sixty nine percent of the participants were
white, 13% were Hispanic, 5% were African American, 3% were Native American, 1% were Asian, and
3% were other. Six percent of the participants had a language disorder. Again, we considered positive
correlation coefficients ranging from .20 to .29 to be weak, coefficients ranging from .30 to .39 to be
moderate, coefficients ranging from .40 to .69 to be strong, and coefficients at or above .70 to be very
strong.
Student performance reported in the studies used to evidence criterion-related validity most likely
does not represent the full range of performance on the criterion measures. This restricted range in
test scores tends to underestimate the correlations (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990; Henriksson & Wolming,
1998; Thorndike, 1949). Thus, coefficients were corrected for range and attenuation. Corrected and
uncorrected coefficients are reported in Tables 13, 14, 15, and 16.
In the following analyses, we compared the CUBED-3 NLM Listening retell highest score to scores
from several criterion measures of language (Table 9). We also compared CUBED-3 composite
scores to the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) assessment (Tables 14, 15, and 16). CUBED-3
composite scores were calculated by converting z-scores to scaled scores, and then summing
those scaled scores to reflect decoding, language, and reading constructs. The majority of these
comparisons, presented in correlation coefficients, offer strong evidence of concurrent and divergent,
criterion-related validity for the CUBED-3.

RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY
Predictive Validity
Evidence of validity can be derived by examining how well the CUBED-3 relates to future performance
on other tests designed to measure similar constructs (Anastasi & Urbina, 1997). Because results
on the CUBED-3 in the fall were used to place students into language and decoding interventions,
the predictive validity analyses are confounded by having used the predictive criteria to help
prevent failure on the criterion measures. Clearer conclusions may have been possible if this biasing
relationship were not present, although given earlier research, failure to intervene would have had
negative ethical implications and a negative impact on student performance. To demonstrate the
predictive validity of the CUBED-3, we studied its relationship to the Measures of Academic Progress
(MAP) and Wyoming PAWS reading assessments. We used regression, correlation, and discriminant
function analyses to examine the predictive validity of the CUBED-3.
In Table 18, we report R2 coefficients of determination to indicate the extent to which combinations of
CUBED-3 raw scores collected in the fall with 1,512 kindergarten through third grade students were
predictive of the MAP assessment in the winter. R2 interpretation is highly dependent upon the testing
context. For predicting reading, we consider R2 values above .10 (10% accounted variance) to be
meaningful.
In Tables 19, 20, and 21, we report correlation coefficients (r) to indicate the relationship between fall
CUBED-3 composite scores and winter MAP scores. We consider coefficients ranging from .20 to .29
to be weak, coefficients ranging from .30 to .39 to be moderate, coefficients ranging from .40 to .69 to
be strong, and coefficients at or above .70 to be very strong.
In Table 22, we report sensitivity and specificity derived from discriminant function analyses that examined
the predictive validity of the combined NLM Listening Retell and the NLM Reading Retell for end of
year PAWS and MAP results. These analyses included 71 third grade students attending two different
elementary schools in Wyoming and 681 third grade students from across the U.S. Sensitivity in this case
represents the extent to which the combined NLMs accurately identified students who were at risk on
PAWS and MAP, and specificity refers to the extent to which the combined NLMs accurately identified
students who were not at risk on PAWS and MAP. For diagnostic instruments, such as norm-referenced
standardized language assessments, sensitivity and specificity at or above 80% are generally considered
acceptable. For universal screeners such as the CUBED-3, sensitivity and specificity are often expected to
be lower. Sensitivity and specificity provide evidence of both predictive validity and construct validity.
In Table 23, we report sensitivity and specificity derived from discriminant function analyses that
examined the predictive validity of the CUBED-3 for end of year PAWS results. These analyses
included 71 third grade students attending two different elementary schools in Wyoming. Sensitivity
in this case represents the extent to which the CUBED-3 accurately identified students who were
at risk on PAWS, and specificity refers to the extent to which the CUBED-3 accurately identified
students who were not at risk on PAWS. For diagnostic instruments, such as norm-referenced
standardized language assessments, sensitivity and specificity at or above 80% are generally
considered acceptable. For universal screeners such as the CUBED-3, sensitivity and specificity are
often expected to be lower. Sensitivity and specificity provide evidence of both predictive validity and
construct validity (see below). The results of the regression, correlation, and discriminant analyses
indicate that the CUBED-3 is moderately to strongly predictive of the MAP and PAWS assessment.

Longitudinal Cohort Study: Kindergarten to Fifth Grade
In a separate longitudinal study, we administered the CUBED-3 assessment to 162 kindergarten
students in a school district in the Midwest and then administered the CUBED-3 to those same
students every year until third grade. We used binary logistic regression and receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) analyses to examine their performance in fifth grade on the WYTOPP state
reading assessment, with poor performance indicated as a summative score below the 16th percentile

reflecting the simple view of reading.

Construct Validity
Evidence of construct validity supports the theoretical construct that a test purports to measure.
We provide several forms of evidence that support the construct validity of the CUBED-3, including
evidence that the CUBED-3 is sensitive to growth over time, reflects both oral and written language,
and is sensitive to growth due to intervention. We also provide evidence that the CUBED-3 reflects
the underlying traits pertaining to decoding and language (using factor analysis). Evidence that the
CUBED-3 accurately classifies students who have reading difficulty, which is provided in the Predictive
Validity section of this manual, also offers evidence of construct validity.
Measuring Academic Language
The NLM is designed to provide information on academic oral and written language. An initial question
is whether the NLM includes the items needed to measure this proposed construct. The fact that
the NLM elicits narrative language samples goes a long way in establishing that such a construct is
indeed being measured. A language sample certainly has the advantage of transparency – it is without
question a sample of language. For this very reason, a language sample is absolved from traditional
internal structure analyses. The relationship between the test items (e.g., the narrative structure and
the language complexity used to construct that narrative) is perfectly related to a narrative language
construct. Of course, a language sample is just that – a sample – and it may not fully represent a
student’s language ability (Shohamy, 1995). It is important to examine the authenticity of the language
samples elicited, and the extent to which the test measures a student’s ability to use that language in
the academic setting. Morrow (1979) suggested that language tests should examine the performance
of purpose-driven, interactive, authentic language in a natural context which is at times unpredictable.
In the NLM, model narratives are constructed so that they reflect the very same language complexity
found in an academic context. This deliberate design means that there is a very real possibility that
asking students to listen to or read those passages and then retell them will provide information on
their ability to understand and produce such academic language. An NLM narrative retell is conveyed
with communicative purpose in an interaction between the examiner and the child. The focus is on
behavioral performance that attempts to replicate a real-life, non-testing situation.
Based on the assertions we have outlined for the CUBED-3 assessment, the NLM subtest should
measure the construct of academic oral and written language for preschool and school-age students
for the purpose of universal screening, progress monitoring, and informing instruction. This a pretty
tall order, especially since the ability to produce and comprehend language is dependent on multiple
factors. For example, how can an assessment measure language and reading comprehension when
comprehension is not a single unitary construct (Catts, 2015)? Comprehension is so dependent
upon multiple factors, that a single assessment cannot ever fully measure reading comprehension
across an apparently infinite combination of contextual and content variables. It may be possible
to test a student across many different contexts and obtain a comprehension profile (Kamhi, 2019),
yet this would not be feasible for a universal screener or progress monitoring tool that has efficiency
requirements. Furthermore, it would not be accurate to suggest that prior knowledge is absolutely
necessary for comprehension. Students can gain new knowledge when listening to or reading
content that is unfamiliar to them. This requires, among several things, motivation, working memory,
attention, morphological awareness, inferential word learning skills, and familiarity with complex

RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY
syntactic constructions. Acquiring knowledge is also facilitated through mental schemas, such as
story grammar. Note that learning something new is less related to specific content and more related
to generalized skills. Students who can learn these skills without unusual difficulty are the very same
students who do not have language disorder. Conversely, students with a language disorder, by the
very nature of the construct itself, will have difficulty learning language. Progress monitoring over time
can measure this language learning potential.
We propose that a criterion-referenced measure of language designed to assess academic language
in a universal screening and progress monitoring application should focus on learning potential and
general processes. Such a construct could be measured using a response to intervention or multi-
tiered systems of support process, or through dynamic assessment or progress monitoring coupled
with explicit instruction. The NLM is designed to be an integral part of a multi-tiered system of support
and uses progress monitoring procedures. The NLM measures a student’s ability to learn academic
language over time, which is less focused on specific content and more focused on what will best
indicate which students will struggle with understanding and producing academic language.
Measuring Word Recognition
The DDM is specifically designed to measure key skills required for word recognition, including
phonemic awareness, identification of letter-sound correspondences, orthographic mapping of
temporarily and permanently irregularly spelled words, recoding of different syllable types, recognition
of affixes, and reading fluency (CWPM). The three lower strands and subordinate strands of
Scarborough’s reading model are specifically addressed in the CUBED-3, and the fact that the DDM
specifically measures those strands goes a long way in establishing that word recognition-related skills
are indeed being measured. Measures of word recognition that most accurately reflect that construct
are nonsense word recoding tasks, as found in the Decoding Inventory subtest, irregular word reading
tasks, as found in the Irregular Words subtest, and a reading fluency task, where connected text
is read. In fact, reading fluency, whether with contrived decodable texts or with 100% “authentic”
texts, clearly reflects the construct of word recognition. Of course, written text is bound by specific
vocabulary which can vary greatly, and a particular passage may not fully represent a student’s ability
to recognize all words. We controlled for this variance to a degree by constructing nearly 100%
decodable passages for the first and second grade NLM Reading benchmark and progress monitoring
subtests. This allows for a tighter control over the measurement of what has likely been specifically
taught and allows examiners to determine whether a student is responding to instruction. We contend
that measuring a student’s ability to decode syllable types and patterns that they have not yet learned
is not a productive use of time.
A Special Note on Response Processes for Comprehension
Test content includes themes, wording, format of test items, tasks, and questions. Administration
and scoring can also be relevant to content-based evidence. A language sample that elicits
complex, academic language that is representative of a student’s language ability probably won’t
have construct underrepresentation or construct-irrelevance, but the way the language sample is
analyzed most certainly could. The constraints imposed by the purposes of universal screening
and progress monitoring preclude a deep analysis. When a test is designed to be administered and
scored by examiners who have limited formal training in language sample analysis, the complexity

of the analysis has to be reduced. Here is where the NLM most certainly is most at risk for construct
underrepresentation. We have attempted to identify general processes or schema that can be
recognized by a teacher or paraprofessional, for example, who may not have a strong language
background. The NLM expects examiners to score a student’s inclusion of major story grammar
elements, score important temporal and causal subordinating conjunctions, relative pronouns that
indicate relative subordination, vocabulary complexity, and calculate the extent to which a complete
episode has been produced. The NLM also measures a student’s ability to answer factual questions
and make text-to-text and text-to-self/word inferences. There is always tension between reliability,
efficiency, ease of administration, ease of scoring, and validity for a language progress monitoring tool,
nevertheless, when compared to the early comprehension measures currently being used in many of
the schools across the U.S., we are confident that the NLM is a step in the right direction (Petersen &
Stoddard, 2018).
There is also the question of what task we want the students to perform in a criterion-referenced
language test. Language samples can be elicited in a variety of ways. The generation of fictional or
personal stories can be prompted, or the elicitation of retells could be the focus. Pictures can also
be used to elicit language samples. A narrative retell of a personal-themed story is the response we
expect from students on the NLM retell portion of the CUBED-3. This was purposefully chosen for
several reasons. First a retell task allows for there to be carefully constructed parallel forms. Second,
a retell can be scored in real time because the examiner has prior exposure to the story and can
anticipate the content and its structure. Third, a personal story themed on universally applicable
events (e.g., getting lost, getting hurt) can help mitigate the confound of prior exposure or experience
with the test content. Although no doubt some stories will resonate stronger with some students
than others, at the very least the stories are generally relatable. Also, there is a primer story or more
than one story elicited. This is particularly important because we found that the first administration
of an NLM subtest is a “shock to the system” for many students, and their responses did not reflect
their language potential. We noted that a second NLM administration immediately after the first
administration consistently yielded more complex and complete narrative retells. Finally, a retell is
the integration of receptive and expressive language – of which empirical evidence is beginning to
demonstrate are not separate constructs. For example, unless a student has a mental model of what
they are trying to produce expressively, they will not be able to produce it (Leonard in AJSLP).

Sensitivity to growth due to change over time

instruction should show this progression during which those skills are developing or being taught.
Means and standard deviations of some of the CUBED-3 measures that are consistently administered
at different time points throughout the year are presented in Table 29. A one-way repeated measures
ANOVA indicated a significant difference in narrative retell scores from the beginning to the middle
of the year for kindergarten (F(1, 214) = 127.92, p <0.001, η2 = .37), first grade (F(1, 208) = 35.03, p

performance on the CUBED-3 measures also increases as expected. More specific data on mean

Factor Analysis
If the subtests of an assessment are significantly correlated, this can be evidence that the subtests
are all measuring a related construct. The CUBED-3 is designed to measure two major constructs:
word recognition and language. Therefore, subtests within those two measures should reflect
this. Factor analysis is conducted to explore the degree to which underlying traits of a test can be
identified and the extent to which those traits reflect the theoretical model on which the test is based.
We have investigated and reported the factor loadings for the word recognition-related subtests
of the CUBED-3, yet the newly revised CUBED-3 required additional investigation, particularly
the NLM subtest, which reports two composites: The NLM Retell Composite score and the NLM
Comprehension Composite score. These two composite scores reflect the theorized factors assessed
by the NLM. The results of the factor analysis indicated that the NLM measured the two factors that
were theorized. We labeled the two factors as “retell” and “comprehension”. These two factors align
with the composite scores on the NLM. Figure 6 displays a path diagram of the factor analysis with
completely standardized values for the two-factor solution.

A CFA was conducted to test two-factor measurement models of the NLM and ELM Flowcharts. Items
were initially specified based on an evaluation of the extent to which they theoretically fit into the latent
constructs. A two-factor model was hypothesized to reflect the distinctions between microstructure
(grammatical/lexical features) and macrostructure (discourse features) typically employed by
researchers and practitioners in the communication sciences. All models were estimated using the
mean-and-variance-adjusted weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimator.
The CFA was assessed for exact fit via a maximum likelihood (ML) χ² appraisal. Exact model fit would
be concluded if a non-significant χ² value (p > .05) was found. In case of model misspecification,
approximate fit was evaluated using standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR), comparative fit
index (CFI)/ Tucker-Lewis Index (1973, TLI), and root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA).
Hu and Bentler (1999) recommend using these calculations with ML methods to determine the extent
to which a model displays sufficient evidence of fit for model misspecification. According to these
studies, approximate fit may be assumed if a model achieves the following fit index values: a SRMR
<.08 (primary criterion) and either a CFI/TLI >.95 or an RMSEA >.06 (secondary criteria). Additionally,
Brown (2015) suggested factor loadings of individual items must be greater than or equal to .30 or .40
to be considered acceptable in applied research. We applied these criteria to guide decision-making
regarding adjustments (e.g., item deletions or correlations) to the proposed model.

To determine model specifications, researchers reviewed CFA model fit indices, individual item
factor loadings, and modification indices for the original models (Model 1 of narrative and expository
academic language, respectively) in Mplus (Version 8; Muthén & Muthén, 2017). Item decisions were
made by first looking at modification indices to identify indicators that were either strongly correlated
with another item, or that were potentially crossloading onto the non-indicated factor. Modification
index values were interpreted in light of our conceptual understanding of the indicators based on
research, how they might relate to the overall construct, and how they might interact with each other
in productive language. Large modification index values that were consistent with theory and prior
research were tested through modified models. Modification index values that were significant but
inconsistent with prior research were not tested (i.e., items were not removed or evaluated on another
factor). Researchers then reviewed factor loadings to determine whether there were any items that, if
removed, might make the instrument more accurate in capturing the identified construct.
For expository academic language conceived through the two-factor ELM Flowchart model, four
additional models were specified. For the two-factor NLM Flowchart model, analyses were conducted
for two additional models. Table 30 displays fit index values for the different models.
ELM Flowchart Model Specifications
Modification indices for ELM Flowchart Model 1 signaled notable correlations between the main idea
and passage cohesion indicators (generation M.I. = 24.86; retell M.I. = 22.29). These two indicators
are conceptually interdependent; passage cohesion assesses the extent to which the information units
support an explicitly stated main idea. Hence in Model 2, researchers controlled for this correlation.
Upon further review, it was hypothesized that passage cohesion may actually capture main idea
entirely within its operational definition.
Researchers reviewed factor loadings and found that the data were consistent with this hypothesis:
main idea loaded onto the specified factor with less power than passage cohesion (difference score
for retell = .23; difference score for generation = .13). Hence in Model 3, we tried deleting the main
idea indicator to assess any differential changes in fit index values. Modification index values
also suggested that the vocabulary item crossloaded across Factors 1 and 2 (generation M.I. =
55.84; retell M.I. = 67.74). This relationship was somewhat expected. Vocabulary is closely related
to information units in that the more an individual knows about a specific topic, the greater their
vocabulary knowledge. Conceptually, this item could be grouped with the Passage Structure or
Linguistic Complexity factor; however, indicators that cross-load onto multiple factors can pose threats
to discriminant validity. Therefore in Model 4, vocabulary was grouped within the Passage Structure
factor to assess differences of fit. Finally, in Model 5 the transitions item was removed due to poor
loading onto the indicated factor (generation = 0.07; retell = 0.18).
There were several unexpectedly high modification index values that were inconsistent with prior
research. Causal ties and temporal ties showed some evidence of correlation for retell samples
only (M.I. = 31.62). Students may have used these structures in tandem when retelling expository
passages because they were modeled together in the retell passage. Correlations between concluding
statement and main idea scores were noted (retell M.I. = 28.97; generation M.I. = 51.88). However, the
concluding statement item loaded poorly onto the identified factor (retell = 0.27; generation = 0.28),
so it was hypothesized that altering the model to account for this correlation would not significantly
impact the overall model fit.

Model 5 displayed the strongest evidence of fit with the data (generation samples χ²(26) = 175.73, p

factor pattern loadings for Model 5 model ranged from .27 to .79, with significant values for each item.
One indicator, concluding statement, loaded onto its respective factor (Passage Structure) with values
less than .30 (generation samples 0.27; retell samples 0.28). Factor pattern loadings for the best fitting
models of narrative and expository academic language are displayed in Table 31.

Modification indices for Model 1 of narrative academic language indicated noteworthy correlations
between many pairs of indicators. Correlations between nearly all of the story grammar elements
showed up as significant in the modification indices. These correlations were expected, since prior
research has described how the three primary story grammar elements (i.e., problem, attempt to
solve the problem, and resolution) are causally related (Stein & Glenn, 1979). We chose to create
modified models to control for two indicated correlations: problem with plan/attempt (Model 2; retell
M.I. = 85.41; generational M.I. = non-significant) and character with setting (Model 3; retell M.I. =
55.65; generation M.I. = 99.54). Changes in fit index values were observed for models reflecting these
particular correlations because (a) unusually high M.I. values were observed, and (b) conceptually they
are interrelated. Specifically, for Model 2, we reasoned that a plan/attempt to solve a problem cannot

that are typically the first bits of information presented in a story.
Additionally, there were three items that slightly crossloaded onto contra-indicated factors: setting
(retell M.I. = 59.58; generation M.I. = 81.08); character (retell M.I. = 74.72; generation M.I. = 37.31); and
emotion (retell M.I. = 80.84; generation M.I. = 35.29).
Fit indices were evaluated to assess the extent to which model fit improved or got worse as changes
were made to the model. Results show the original NLM Flowchart model of narrative academic
language had the best fit to the data (generation χ²(46) = 743.85, p < .001, SRMR = .06, RMSEA =
.08, CFI = .88, and TLI = .86; retell χ²(46) = 784.80, p < .001, SRMR = .05, RMSEA = .09, CFI = .91,
and TLI = .90). Standardized factor loadings ranged from 0.24 to 0.96, with significant p-values for
each item. Two Narrative Structure items loaded onto the identified factor with values less than .30:
setting (generation = 0.29; retell = 0.54) and emotion (generation samples .24; retell samples .38). It
is important to note that poor factor loadings for these items were below .30 for generation language
samples only. Loadings exceeded the cutoff criteria in retell samples.
Intercorrelations between factor structures for the NLM and ELM Flowcharts are reported in Table
32. Research suggests that intercorrelation values of .80 and below provide sufficient evidence that
factors have separate structures and are likely not unidimensional (Brown, 2015). All intercorrelation
values between identified factors fell below this threshold.

RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY
Economy, Efficiency, and Ease of Administration and Scoring
A CBM must also be economical, time efficient, and be easy to administer and score. These
requirements are somewhat unique to universal screening and progress monitoring tools, yet are
very important because often, CBMs are administered to nearly every student in a school district.
To function properly within the constraints of current budget allocations, a universal screening and
progress monitoring tool that is designed to be administered to a large number of students needs to
be economical.
Not only is money a finite resource, so also is time. Educators are expected to cover a lot of material
or work with a lot of students during each day of instruction. In order to function properly in the school
setting, a universal screening and progress monitoring tool needs to be time efficient. Procedures
must be in place that can be realistically implemented in the school system. There are clear guidelines
on how administer the CUBED-3 assessment in an efficient manner in this manual.
Finally, a language universal screening and progress monitoring tool in many cases needs to be
administered by a large number of educators, including paraprofessionals who might have limited
education or training, especially in an MTSS context. When this is the case, the progress monitoring
tool needs to be easy to administer and score. Because the majority of students in the U.S. have
difficulty meeting grade-level reading comprehension expectations, the problem is not specific to
special education. The reading comprehension issue in the U.S. is a shared general and special
education responsibility. This means that general education teachers and supporting staff who may
not have formal education or training on language assessment will be needed to administer language
and word recognition progress monitoring assessments to a large number of students. These
assessments will need to be feasibly administered and scored with a reasonable amount of training.
Summary of Validity Results
There is considerable evidence to support the validity of the CUBED-3. The CUBED-3 can be used as
a universal benchmark screening and progress monitoring measure of early literacy, decoding, reading
fluency, and comprehension. It can identify students who need intensive intervention and can play an
important role in a multi-tiered system of support for decoding and language.
Obtaining evidence of validity is an on-going process, and additional studies are warranted. We
invite professionals to study this assessment using different samples of students, different statistical
procedures, and different criterion measures. We welcome collaboration and encourage researchers
who examine the CUBED-3’s psychometric properties to share information with us.
